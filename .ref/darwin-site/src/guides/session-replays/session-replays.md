# The complete guide to session replays

Session replays are one of the best tools in your UX toolbox when you want to see how people really navigate through your website and collect the insight you need to fix the user experience and improve conversions.

This guide starts on this page with a full introduction to session replays. Other chapters include a deep-dive into the best ways to watch replays to get actionable insight, a list of case studies and success stories, and a step-by-step set of instructions to help you get started. There’s nothing quite like watching real users interact with your website.

## What are session replays (or session recordings)?

Session replays are renderings of real actions taken by visitors as they browse a website. Replays capture user interactions across multiple pages on desktop and mobile devices.

They are used to gain a real understanding of how users interact with a website, which then helps fix issues, optimize UX, and ultimately improve conversion rate.

## How do session replays help you understand your customers?

Session replays are an extremely powerful tool for gaining insight into how users behave—they are one of the closest things to being in the same room as your users and see exactly how they interact with your site.

Here are some of the most popular ways session replays can teach you more about your customers:

### 1. Understand and empathize with your visitors’ experience

Putting yourself in your users’ shoes allows you to empathize with them, experience what they’re going through as they browse your website, and build a more enjoyable and efficient user experience as a result. It doesn’t take more than 10-20 replays to start seeing where visitors are getting stuck—and you may even already spot what’s persuading them to convert.

### 2. See how users interact with specific website elements

Session replays let you really watch how users interact with key elements on your website. Where users focus, what they click on, which sections they spend a lot of time on, what they skip over… replays allow you to stop speculating about it all and start using real data to make impactful changes.

### 3. Discover bugs, issues, and obstacles

Watching session replays where users get stuck, confused, and frustrated as they experience issues is one of the fastest ways to improve your website.

Obstacles that stop a customer from progressing can be both technical and informational: look out for broken elements and loading issues in addition to misleading micro-copy or unclear instructions.

### 4. Find out why people are leaving your website

Spot opportunities to reduce bounce rates and keep people on your website by watching session replays from users who left your site without converting.

Look for patterns of user behavior—did they navigate erratically? Did they miss an important link? Did they encounter a bug? Answer these questions and you’ll know what needs improving.

### 5. Help team members, clients, and stakeholders make decisions

Session replays are easy to share, straightforward to watch, and provide evidence for getting people onboard before making design decisions and optimizations.

Whether you’re a UX designer, CRO specialist, or marketer, user session replays will help you make data-driven decisions and showcase the effectiveness of your work to people across teams.

## What should you look for in your session replays?

If you’ve never watched user replays before, we recommend just sitting back, clicking ‘play’, and watching a few.

After the first few replays, you will probably begin to notice trends in your visitor behavior and the way they interact and engage with your website or app. You’ll start noticing:

- What elements visitors use to navigate from one page to another
- How visitors interact—or fail to—with buttons and clickable elements
- Unusual mouse activity, for example, wild scrolling or repeated clicking
- If it takes too long to complete an action
- How visitors move around on the page and where they stop

You’ll also be able to see problems that need fixing, like:

- Pages that load incorrectly across different devices and/or browsers
- Functionality that doesn’t work like it should
- Elements that render incorrectly, are missing, or broken
