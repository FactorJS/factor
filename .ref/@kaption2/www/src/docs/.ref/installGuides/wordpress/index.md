# Install on WordPress

### Before You Start

The Kaption tracking code can be installed on [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) Business plan and self-hosted versions of Wordpress from ([Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/)).

Kaption isn't available for users on a [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) free or personal plan since you cannot add Custom HTML or install plugins on these plans.

### Get Tracking Code

Login to [Kaption's Dashboard](https://app.kaption.co/login) and visit "Tracking Code" in the navigation.
