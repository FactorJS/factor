# Install on Webflow

### Before You Start

To add the Darwin tracking code to your [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) website you need a paid site plan. This is because Darwin is installed as "custom code" which is enabled once you upgrade.

### Get Tracking Code

Login to [Darwin's Dashboard](https://app.darwin.so/login) and visit "Tracking Code" in the navigation.
