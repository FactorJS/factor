You can learn the basics for Factor in around 10 minutes. In this document, we'll discuss the hello world example as well as go through the basic ideas needed to create an app.

## Before You Start

Before you get started, you'll need to make sure you have NodeJS version 14 or newer installed. You'll also need to be familiar with NPM and the terminal.

If you're new to Node app development, you may want to learn the basics first. Factor apps use a format familiar to all JavaScript/Node apps, e.g. `package.json`, `node_modules`, etc...

### Vue

Factor uses the latest Vue3 front end framework for all UI. While more languages may be added in the future, currently you'll need to understand Vue basics like components and routes.

### TypeScript

Using Factor will be easiest if you're familiar with latest JavaScript standards such as [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

> In general, it is best to write as much code as possible using types (TypeScript) as it drastically reduces errors and issues at runtime.

## Hello World

The fastest way to see Factor working is to download and run the hello world example. You can reference the files in this project to see the basic ingredients needed.

## Creating a Simple App

To create a basic app, just create a folder and type `npm init`. This will walk you through the steps of creating an initial `package.json`.

### Install Factor CLI

To install Factor and its dependencies, just install the `@factor/cli` module into your project:

```bash
npm install @factor/cli
```

### Setting Up Source

In a Factor project, there are the following "entry files",

- `index.ts` - Application entry file
- `server.ts` - Endpoint server entry file
- `App.vue` - UI Entry file
- `index.html` - HTML scaffold file (all pages)

The entry files must exist in the same folder. Copy these files from the [Hello World example](https://github.com/FactorJS/factor-hello-world) into a folder called `src` and let `package.json` know how to find them by adding `main: src/index.ts`.

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "main": "src/index.ts"
}
```

### Add Config Files

In the root of your project, you can now add configuration files:

- [Factor](https://www.factor.so) as `factor.config.ts`
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as `vite.config.ts` (optional but recommended)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as `tailwind.config.ts` (optional but recommended)

Documentation for Vite/Tailwind is on their website. As for Factor, you can read the configuration documentation.

Once set up your project structure should look like this:

```bash
ðŸ“¦root
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œApp.vue
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.html
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œindex.ts
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œserver.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œfactor.config.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œtailwind.config.js
 â”£ ðŸ“œvite.config.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
```

> You may also want to add standard files such as `.gitignore` and `.eslintrc`, etc.. Reference example projects for additional help getting those set up.

### Routes and Components

Now we are ready to start adding routes and "view" component to associate with those routes.

The `index.ts` entry file should export a function with the name `setup` which returns an object of runtime configuration information. One important property is `routes`. Here just return the entire `vue-router` route array which should tie routes to their respective components.

```ts
// index.ts
import { UserConfigApp } from "@factor/api"

export const setup = (): UserConfigApp => {
  return {
    routes: [
      {
        path: "/",
        component: () => import("./Home.vue"),
      },
    ],
    plugins: [],
  }
}
```

> You'll want to make sure you have your `App.vue` and `Home.vue` (added via routes) set up as standard Vue3 SFCs, if you'd like this to run correctly. [Hello World example](https://github.com/FactorJS/factor-hello-world)

## Run Factor

With these basic files, you're all setup to run Factor. Just run the following command:

```bash
npx factor dev
```
