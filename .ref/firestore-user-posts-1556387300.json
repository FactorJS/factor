I love my multicolored attire.” Well, just let me show you how much black clothing can simplify and improve your travel life.\n\n# It means traveling with less stuff\n\nWhen I decided to start traveling full time about a year and a half ago, the first thing I did was buy a massive bag, large enough to pack a fat 14 year old child.  I perceived I would need to store my months long supply of clothes and other accessories.\n\nHowever, when y0u travel a lot, a big bag like this is a pain. You have to wait in lines, it gets lost, you have to pay fees, etc… I realized I needed to go to the ‘carry on’ only model,  but how?  That’s right, I got rid of the brown shoes, blue pants, multicolored shirts, etc… black always matches black.\n\n\n# Blue jeans are ugly. Brown shoes are pointless.\n\nIn this bag I had black and brown shoes, black and blue pants, etc… First, let me ask you… why does everyone wear blue jeans?  Why blue?  I contend that black jeans will always be better than blue. You can wear black jeans to formal as well as casual events, black jeans look great with most colors while blue doesn’t.  That’s right, people wear blue just because that’s what everyone else does.\n\n# It simplifies your life\n\nBlack matches black, and most importantly, no one notices if you were the same thing multiple times.\n\nThat’s right. You can wear the same shirt two days in a row, no one notices. Same shoes, jacket, etc… it doesn’t matter. The same thing doesn’t apply for different color clothing. Wear that striped blue shirt two days in a row and you will be the laughing stock of your neighborhood.\n\nSo stop playing the whole “you need to wear something different every day,” or the “you can only wear these shoes with this color shirt” game that the fashion companies continually push in an effort to sell more clothes.\n\n# It doesn’t get dirty\n\nBlack clothing is really hard to get dirty. Coffee stain? What coffee stain.\n\nThis means you can wear black shoes and clothing for longer before they start to look old and worn out. Perfect for us nomads.\n\nOne caveat, you still have to worry about is cats. I can verify that cat hair and black clothes can still be a problem.",

    "content": "I’ll start this article with a question: do you respect Picasso as an artist?\n\nI do, but today I appreciate Picasso more as an entrepreneur and businessman than an artist. (As an artist I actually think he was the ultimate sell out.)\n\nWhy? Well that’s the subject of this article. Today I’ll explain Picasso’s story and how you can use some of his techniques to sell your art and find ultimate success.\n\n## The “real” story of Picasso\n\nAlmost no one knows the real story behind how Picasso got his start. Well, it goes something like this…\n\nWhen he was a young man he moved to Paris to chase his dream of being an artist. Like most artists, Picasso struggled to find a way to get people to pay for his art. Because of this he spent these early years nearly destitute in severe poverty. The wikipedia article on Picasso says that he actually burned some of his art to stay warm. He was the quintessential starving artist.\n\n> “What would have become of us if Kahnweiler hadn’t had a business sense?” – Picasso\n\nLuckily about this time Picasso met a man named [Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel-Henry_Kahnweiler), who was a local art dealer in Paris and a business man.\n\nKahnweiler offered Picasso a deal. Specifically, he offered to buy all of Picasso’s pieces and even give him a place to sleep in the back of his gallery. He didn’t give Picasso much in terms of pay, the equivalent of today’s minimum wage, but at least Picasso was surviving from his art and so he was happy.\n\n## Fabricating The “Picasso Story”\n\n> “Fake it ’til you make it.”\n\nAs an art dealer, Kahnweiler had some very important insights into what makes someone buy a piece of art.\n\nKahnweiler knew that people don’t buy “art” at all. They buy a story and a brand; and maybe most importantly, people buy art as a status symbol.\n\nSo that’s what he tapped into.\n\nWhile Picasso had been used to either giving his art away or selling it extremely cheap; Kahnweiler marked his art up to astronomical prices.\n\nHe fabricated a story to tell people about Picasso and let them know he was the “next big thing.” He created urgency by telling the buyer they would be missing a hell of an investment if they passed on the opportunity to buy a Picasso.\n\nAnd while these original buyers were more or less duped; **they actually did make a hell of an investment.** As they say, “fake it til you make it.”\n\n## Selling Out\n\nOne of Picasso's 5-second \"masterpieces\" or mind hack. You decide.\nMasterpiece or mind hack?\nA couple of years ago, I went to look at an original Picasso for sale at a local art gallery.  The piece was for sale for only $1.3 million dollars; a hell of a deal for an original Picasso, I thought.\n\n![Masterpiece or mind hack?](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjs0nf7iv%2Fpicasso.png.png?alt=media&token=71a89851-13b1-48ca-84c8-dad811a3a24d)\n\nThe piece itself looked like it had been drawn by a kindergarten student with crayon in approximately 5 minutes. But hey, it was an original Picasso, right?\n\nThere was a roman number IV written on the piece. I asked the dealer what that meant, and she said “oh, that means this is the fourteenth piece Picasso did… **that day.**”\n\nSo I asked, “What? That day? How did Picasso make fourteen pieces of art in a day?” and the dealer responded, “Actually, later on in his career Picasso didn’t actually paint or draw most his pieces, he would do the original and have his apprentices emulate them, then he would sign them and sell them as his own. He would sometimes sign 30 pieces or more in a day.”\n\nThat’s when I realized that when Picasso got older, he became the ultimate sellout. He realized that people would pay crazy money for anything with an original Picasso signature on it, it didn’t matter what the content of the art was.\n\nAt this point Picasso ceased to be an artist, he became exclusively a businessman with a very lucrative brand.\n\n## The Moral of the Story\n\n![Picasso's Signature](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjs0nf7iv%2Fpicasso-sig.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=6ba2889a-e051-4a12-b302-9101ac28dea2)\n\nWhat can we learn from the story of Picasso?\n\nWell, the most important take away is that people don’t buy art for the art. They buy the brand; or specifically, they will buy their perception of a brand. Often times they are buying that art as a status symbol they can use to subtly show off to their friends.. (“Wow, you have a Picasso?!” “Ohhh, the crayon and roman numeral IV in this piece just spoke to me and I had to have it.”)\n\nAs an artist, what does this mean for you?\n\n- **Build a Recognizable Brand**\nCreate a focused brand and reinforce it in all your work. It doesn’t matter if you’re a painter, musician, dancer, etc.. you need a brand that you can build and imbue with meaning. For that, start by reading the Fiction article on {% post_link how-to-create-a-name-for-your-company How to Name Your Company. %}\n\n- **Create A Story**\nAny good brand in art has a story. It doesn’t have to be a great story, it just has to be one that others can tell about you.\n- **Fake It ‘Til You Make It**\nYour gonna need to find a way to make people believe you are already a big deal, even when you’re just starting out. There are many ways of doing this. For another example of this, watch the [Movie Exit Through the Gift Shop](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587707/) by Banksy.\n- **Be Expensive**\nIn branding, we talk about price positioning a lot. Is your brand the cheap generic, or the expensive premium version. In art, you ALWAYS want to be positioned as an expensive product. Just by insisting on a high price, people will appreciate your art more and  will pay a lot more for it.",

    "content": "A few years ago I began to realize the importance of communication and proper research in business. During this time I studied many techniques and books. However, more than any other Leonardo DaVinci, gave me an important revelation that I still use to this day.\n\nI believe this technique is one of the secret’s to being an innovator. The advantages of the following technique are the following:\n\n* Better Cognition\n* Enhanced Ability to Innovate\n* Better research and exposure to ideas\n\n## DaVinci’s Notes\n\n> “However, that’s when I realized that the fact that these notes existed, and that they were so detailed, was a revelation in itself.”\n\nOne day I made a spontaneous purchase of a large coffee table size book filled with all of Leonardo’s notes. These notes have become quite famous for their artistic value, and I was hoping that Leo would drop some insights.\n\nOn first reading it, I didn’t notice too many things that stood out in terms of knowledge.  Most Leo’s insights were simply outdated.\n\nHowever, that’s when I realized that the fact that these notes existed, and that they were so detailed, was a revelation in itself.\n\nHow many people today do such meticulous research and study?\n\nSo after realizing this, and studying DaVinci’s approach, I created what I call “The DaVinci Method” for research and note taking.\n\n## DaVinci Method\n\n### The Technique\nIf you take a look at DaVinci’s notes, he always used plain pieces of paper and filled them up with notes in an unformatted way. He would do detailed sketches and fill every page up with insights in his notes. Based on this, here are some rules on taking notes…\n\n* **Take Notes** – Most importantly you should have a notebook that you keep with you all the time. Compliment this by using Evernote to keep track in an electronic format.\n* **Draw Pictures** – Drawing pictures and 3-d forms is better than text only. This is because our memory works better when it can associate information with objects.\n* **Don’t Format** – Don’t buy notebooks with lines on the pages. Keep the notes unformatted and allow your mind to freely structure the information on the page.\n* **Write Down Everything** – When studying something, you may feel that a particular observation is obvious or not worth writing down. These cases can in fact be the most important thing to document, since people often over estimate their ability to remember things.\n\n![Example of DaVinci’s Note Taking](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjs0r6coe%2Fdvnotes.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=a08e5cec-df8b-4880-9540-5fc79f9e33b3)\n\n\n### The Process\nFor every subject DaVinci wanted to master, he went through the same steps. I believe this gave him a formatted way to get access to all the good ideas related to a subject, so he could then compare and contrast them.\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjs0r6coe%2FDaVinci-Method-diagram.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=4db32e46-a270-4a42-9680-a6d85991bbe0)\n\n* **Theory** – Studying theory (e.g. books) will teach you the basics and give you the perspective to understand subtlety in the work of others (competition and masters)\n* **Masters** – Provided you have perspective from ‘theory’… Studying those who have ‘mastered’ a subject will show you the best ideas to employ in that subject.\n* **Competition** – Once you are aware of theory and best practice, studying competition will show you how ideas can be applied to a situation relevant to your own.\n* **Get Feedback** – Gaining objective feedback from respected colleagues will give you the ability to see in your own work, what others do. Feedback works in concert with your perspective on a subject. All feedback should be reflected on; although not all should be used.\n\nHere is a quote from DaVinci on taking feedback on your work:\n\n>“Be curious to hear with patience the opinions of others. Consider and weigh well whether those who find fault have ground or not for blame, and if so, amend. But if not, make as though you have not heard, or if they should be someone you esteem, show them by arguments the cause of their mistake.”",

    "content": "Copywriting is a challenging art and there are lots of unwritten rules. In my time, I've taken note of a few ideas that I feel help you write better copy, more quickly. \n\nSome of these “laws” are non-obvious, so my goal is that even experienced copywriters will learn something from this guide.  Newer writers will get a strong framework to build from.\n\nFirst, why are these rules important?\n\n>“Worry not that no one knows of you; seek to be worth knowing.” – Confucius\n\nCopywriting is much more that simply writing to convince people to buy your product. You can use it to do things which are much more powerful.\n\n**Good copy lets you**\n\n* Build a tribe / following\n* Create loyal customers that love your brand\n* Create a feeling of kinship in the reader\n* Start a movement or new trend\n\nAnd these laws are also needed to prevent the effects of bad copy (which I’ve had to learn the hard way).\n\n**Bad copy can easily let you be perceived as:**\n\n* Greedy\n* Arrogant\n* Inexperienced\n* Boring\n\nOk, so now hopefully  you get the point. Let’s get into the 21 Laws of Good Copywriting…\n\n## The 21 Laws of Good Copywriting\n\n1. **The First Rule: Always Be Human**\n  * Act and write as a human would. If saying something out loud would sound out of context, arrogant, stiff/corporate, boring, then you are not doing good copywriting.\n  * For example, a human would never say “Buy this now!” they would say, “Check this out, we think you’ll like it.“\n\n2. **Assign ownership to the reader**\n  * Maximize the words “You”, “Your”\n  * Never user “I”, “we”, or “our”. Using self-centered language like “I” and “we” gives the impression that you only care about yourself or your business/solutions rather than the customer.\n\n3. **Provide explanation**\n    * Use the word ‘because’ often, because it gives context and explanation.\n    * Imagine every point you make followed by the question Why? in the customers mind.\n\n4. **Avoid the cliche’**\n  * Endeavor to entertain, write uniquely yet simply.\n  * Cliche copywriting is comparable to the stock images of business people giving each other high five.\n \n5. **Never mention competition by name**\n- Speaking badly about the competition will always make you look bad instead.\n- Usually seen as arrogant\n- What To do instead: Discuss the competitive approach or category and why it might not be right for the reader\n\n6. **Don’t use the word “very”**\n  * Why? Unoriginal. Use the extreme form of the word instead.\n  * Example: instead of ‘very tired’ use ‘exhausted‘, instead of ‘very cold’ use ‘freezing’ and so on…\n\n7. **Start sentences with Verbs and Active Voice**\n  * If you’re struggling on starting a sentence, then follow this rule: add power to your sentences by starting them with verbs.\n\n8. **Don’t use exclamation points!**\n  * Exclamation points are often be seen as trying to hard, yelling or selling (as in used car selling). Good writing doesn’t do any of these. In my opinion, exclamation points are for use by experts only.\n\n9. **Use “advanced” punctuation**\n  * What I call “advanced” punctuation allows you to be read in a way that is closer to your intent (and also makes you look smart).\n  * For example, use m-dashes–they’re great for asides–and semi-colons; they are nice for combining closely related sentences.\n\n10. **Different Headline Styles are OK**\n  * There are different formats for headings and titles. Using a full sentence is okay and good style (used by Apple). These should be formatted with Capitalized first letter and period.\n    * Example: “[Whatever] for the rest of us.”\n  * If not a sentence, use all caps except for common connecting words like ‘the’, ‘as’, ‘in’ and ‘of’.\n    * Example: Build the Best Websites in the World\n\n11. **And old preposition rules can be broken**\n  * They say don’t start or end a sentence with a preposition. It’s ok to do this, it adds a conversational tone and shows you’re not afraid to break some rules.\n\n12. **Icons, images, and media are copy**\n  * These days icons, images and media are very important to copy. People have short attention spans and need to be persuaded quickly. Learn basic graphic design and how and when to use these formats.\n\n13. **Never compliment yourself**\n  * One of the most common mistakes by beginning (and sometimes advanced) writers is complimenting yourself.\n  * For example, “join the amazing community” is a form of complimenting yourself and the community.\n  * Instead compliment what it will do for the reader: ““Join this community which will help you to do amazing things.”\n\n14. **Be inclusive, don’t use the word “our”**\n  * You always want to instill a feeling of kinship or ownership in the part of the reader.\n  * Instead of using the word “our” you should usually be using the word “your” instead.\n\n15. **Use bulleted lists Often**\n  * Use bulleted lists as often as possible. They provide the reader a clear way of seeing differing points or attributes.\n  * They also increase the speed at which a reader can scan your copy.\n\n16. **Don’t use fluff, shorter is better**\n  * Remove wording that is overly descriptive, complimentary or trying too hard.\n  * People have an adverse reaction when they notice pointless or redundant text.\n\n17. **Don’t try too hard**\n  * Why? Trying to hard makes people feel like they are being sold, which makes them feel like they are not getting a good deal.\n  * Your attitude should NOT be: “Try this super cool widget, it’s amazing and will change your life forever OMG!”\n  * Your attitude should be “Here’s what we’ve got for you, we think it will help you with your goals. Try it, we’d love to be a part of your success.”\n\n18. **Use humor and jokes**\n  * Don’t be boring. Add jokes and other humor to your writing as you might in a conversation. (Copywriting isn’t boring right?)\n\n19. **The best copywriting is education**\n  * Steve Jobs used to say “the best marketing is education.” This applies fully to copywriting. Speak as if you’re advising someone on a purchase or action, educate them to the features and tradeoffs.\n\n21. **Use the correct format for the job**\n  * There are four stages reader go through as they are reading copy: A-I-D-A. You always want to use the correct communication format for each…\n    1. **Awareness** – Landing page format. Use the 3 second rule: “Let the know what you do and how it can help them within 3 seconds”\n    2. **Interested** – Use product tours, media, comparison tables. Help people understand where your product fits in the world.\n    3. **Decision** – Use long format text and stories. Make the user feel safe and that there is a safety net for any decisions they make.\n    4. **Action** – This is where you take money or information from users. Remove all distractions and guide them through each step.\n\n22. **Even the best rules are meant to be broken**\n  * As they say, to be an artist you need to learn the rules in order to break them.\n  * Except for these laws, never break these ;)",

    "content": "If you're starting a company, then choosing the name is one of the first and most important things you'll have to decide on. \n\nNaming is a skill and somewhat counter-intuitive; there are places where people spend way too much time and some major mistakes that can be made. \n\n## Principle #1 – Naming is not a group activity.\n\nThere are many nuances to naming a business. It’s an art. This is why you should never try and name something with a group of people. One person, with a solid knowledge of branding and naming dynamics, should present some solid options from the rest to pick from.\n\nIf you attempt to name something with a group you will end up with the blandest, most typical, boring name. Simply because groups tend to remove the edge and move towards conformity. Also, the other members of the group may not be familiar with naming pitfalls and will argue with you endlessly about some of the following points…\n\n## Principle #2 – A good name does NOT explain what you do.\n\nA lot of people think that a brand name should somehow explain what there company does. \nThese category of naming is called “descriptive” branding and there are many downsides to it. \n\nThink about it, your brand is always presented with *context* so adding a description in the name is unnecessary and redudant. Imagine, if Google had named themselved \"Good Search Inc,\" then every time a journalist would introduce the company it would go something like this: \n> Good Search is a, ah, um, a good search company that makes it easier to search for stuff.\n\nSee what I mean?\n\nPrimarily, this naming strategy will always tax your marketing budget because the brands are pulled from a small group of keywords hence they blend together. Ultimately, you end up spending your advertising dollars building the brands you’ve incorporated into your name (in this case WordPress). This makes descriptive names are the opposite of good marketing. Other reasons they’re bad:\n\n* They’re boring\n* They’re unoriginal\n* They have no personality\n* You can’t build brand awareness\n* Undifferentiated from competition\n\n### Pitfalls\n\nSo why do people fall for this? Here are the common pitfalls”\n\n* **How will people know what we do if it’s not in the name?** Your company name will always be presented with context. For example, if Google had named themselves GreatSearchEngine, then a journalist writing about the company would have to say something like this.. “Today, we’re writing about GreatSearchEngine, they are a… um, great search engine for searching the web.” See? That’s redundant.\n\n* **When can this work?**\nDescriptive naming can be a good strategy when you want do deflect brand awareness towards a parent brand. For example, Facebook seems to be using this strategy with their apps, using descriptive names like Messenger and Pages, etc.., which focus you on the parent Facebook brand instead.\n\n## Principle #3 – Don’t negatively break down a name\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjs1754xd%2Fvirgin-america-logo.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=d9a2b1da-101a-43a8-9a16-355361582872)\n\nAnother common mistake in branding is to take every name candidate and break it down, trying to think of every possible negative connotation the name can have with customers.  This is a mistake because customers never take a company name and dissect it for negative meaning. To a customer, they use the name to understand a brand’s personality and build up from there.  For example, if I suggested I wanted to name a new airline something like… oh, Virgin, here’s what a naming committee might say:\n\n* Virgin Airlines?\n  * People will think we are new at this, and that’s not what we want!\n  * People will think we’re a sex toy company\n  * That name nothing to do with flying\n\nNow clearly, the reality is that Virgin is one of the most admired and recognized brands in the space. So all those people would have been wrong.\n\nA brand name should simply represent the personality of a company. In Virgin’s case, the brand exemplifies ‘sexy’ (as they hire lots of attractive flight attendants!) so it’s a perfect fit.\n\n## Principle #4 – Don’t choose a name because you can get the .com (but think about the trademark)\n\nSeems pretty straightforward, but over the last 20 or so years, there have been many-a-company named simply because the domain name was available. Even I fell for this trap with my first company the admittedly poorly named, eDoctr.\n\nPeople make this mistake because they want people to easily be able to get to the website.\n\nThe reality is that, yes, it’s always nice to have a nice domain name but it is exponentially more important to have a solid brand than a good domain.\n\nMy suggestion is that you choose a good brand, and then find a clever domain that makes sense around that brand.  Also you can consider .io or .co domain names as well. Like [Angel.co](https://angel.co) for AngelList; which is solid!\n\nOne caveat is that you definitely *should* pay attention to trademark right as this has legal implications. Simply, if you choose the same name as someone else in your space, that is a deal killer. A quick Google search for the [name] +\n\nshould let you know if you’ll have a problem.\n\n## Principle #5 – The best names are two syllables long and easy to spell (phonetically)\n\nThis one is basic psychology. People tend to build basic schemas for things that make them easier to say, spell, and remember.  Because of this, people naturally gravitate towards brands that have low cognitive load (how’s that for a first principle?).\n\nSo when it comes to phonetics, that is, how your brand sounds when it’s said out loud, it’s important it has only two syllables, at least, as pronounced. For example, do you ever wonder why we call Los Angeles, “LA”; but we never call New York, “NY”? This is because people tend to want to shorten things to two syllables. The same goes for one syllable brands, people tend to lengthen those. So you might see many one syllable brands get the ‘.com’ thrown in with the brand for this reason (e.g. Moz.com instead of just Moz).\n\nSome brands like Amazon or my friend Maren’s company, Zirtual, are technically more than two syllables; however, when they are said out loud they are typically pronounced with two syllables. Try it! Amazon is typical said “Am-Zon” and Zirtual “Zirch-ul”.. neat concept huh?\n\nThe same goes for spelling, people want names that are easy to spell and type on a keyboard.  You may want to do some testing regarding this. Ask people to spell the name, if most can’t on the first try, then you probably want to keep looking.  Try typing the name, make sure it’s not awkward and you can do it fast, this might be for your own benefit as much as your customers!\n\n## Principle #6 – Name to represent a brand’s (hence company’s) personality.\n\nOver time your name tends to help shape the personality of your company’s brand and hence its culture, values, and more. This again underlines why the name is so important.  Here are some examples of this:\n\n* Apple: Human\n* Virgin:  Sexy, Youthful\n* Google: Playful\n* Twitter: Playful, child-like\n* Microsoft: evil corporate empire (lol)\n.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHopefully the above principles help you on your way to naming a company. Again there are 6 key principles: \n- Don't choose a descriptive brand \n- Don't choose a name because a URL is available\n- Brand to the personality of a company (not its function)\n- Don't negatively deconstruct\n- Don't name by committee \n- Consider how easy the name is to say and type",

Often times we're limping along, a casuality of our surrounding and past experiences. It's no wonder we end up frustrated from time to time.\n\nThat's why the most critical component in change comes down to habit. \n\n**Habits From Identity**\n\nAn interesting point that James Clear makes in his book [\"Atomic Habits\"](https://www.jamesclear.com)  is that identity and habits are related. What he says is that often times your behavior is out of alignment with the person you would like to become. \n\nThis inevitably leads to unhappiness and failure. The solution is to first reflect on the person you would like to become and the habits that person would have. \n\n### Step 1 - Identify \n\nSo, the first step in changing your life is to decide who you want to be. \n\nWhat do you want to stand for? If you could be any specific person, in essence, who would that person be? \n\nThese are abstract questions, and it may be hard to be specific; but most people know the things they are most looking to achieve: start a company, leave my [job, home town], give an inspirational speech, write a book, etc.. \n\nSo ..start there and work backward... \n\nwho is the type of person that could achieve these things? \nWhat would their day look like?\n\n### Step 2 - Visualize\n\nNext you need to visualize the type of routines you'll need to have to become that person. \n\nWant to start a company? Well, you will likely need to start by building some insights in a key niche area and learning about the basics of business. How would the person you would like to become start to figure these things out?\n\nIf you're like me, I think of a person that fights hard to find the information I need to make better decisions. Whether that means, finding a mentor and embarrasing myself cold calling relevant people than peppering them with questions. \n\n### Step 3 - Strategize\n\nFor most people, the strategize phase is where the mistakes are made. It's not becuase people don't create a strategy, it's that they create strategies that aren't sustainable. \n\nFor instance, someone might resolve to lose weight, but only resolve to eat healthier and \"get to the gym.\" Well, inevitably these vague goals fall apart the minute it is convenient to do so and that person is back to square one. \n\nThat's why to strategize correctly you simply need to do two things: \n\n1. Say when and how often you're going to do something.\n   - e.g. I'm going to hit the gym 5 times a week, after work. I'm going to write at least one page a day for 30 days... \n2. Make sure the task is sustainable. Be careful not to pick a goal that is simply too much to handle without serious compromise. For example, don't resolve to write a chapter every day, because you'll miss one day, then two, then you'll give up. \n\n### Step 4 - Chart\n\nThe final step in changing your life, is to measure how well you maintain your habits.  Note that we aren't necessarily measuring progress, only now well we are sticking to our strategy. \n\nMany of the habits you'll need to change won't be giving you instant feedback, and because of the this most people don't get the immediate gratification or knowledge of progress.  For example, if you eat well for a week you still might not see a lot of progress on the scale; although presumably you'll see it eventually.\n\nBecause humans have an innate need for instant positive feedback, thats why its important to track the positive things you do instead of the results which may be delayed days, weeks or even months. \n\nThats why you need to implement a charting solution. Personally, I track my progress using a simple Google Sheet, a daily google form I email myself, and some generated charts that get emailed me nightly based on all my tracked information. \n\nAlthough this solution is just for myself, I can see how my actions are changing over time and affecting my results. If nothing else, it helps me see how well I'm staying disciplined and if any balls are getting dropped across all my goals. \n\n### Summary\n\nToday is the day. You're ready for something different, so get started. \n\nAll you need to do is start by \n\n**(1) Identify** as your future self by figuring out who you would like to be,  \n\n**(2) Visualize** what habits your preferred future self needs to have, \n\n**(3) Strategize** how you are going to make a change, and what those specific changes need to be  (when and how often) \n\n**(4) Chart** how well you behave each day, giving yourself the feedback you need to stay positve and keep going.",

    "content": "**Eating a well-balanced diet can be difficult when you’re trying to save money, luckily there's healthy foods that you can get at low prices**\n\nBuying food every day can get expensive really quick, but buying your own groceries and cooking at home can save you lot's of money. So here's a list of healthy foods that you can get cheap when you’re grocery shopping on a tight budget.\n\n***\n### 1. Eggs\nEggs can be cooked in so many ways – you can make an omelette for breakfast, hard-boiled with a salad for lunch, or mix them in a simple fried rice plate for dinner. \n\nEggs might be one of the most adaptable and cheap foods. Eggs are incredibly filling and also a great source of protein and loaded with vitamins, minerals and good fats. When you have eggs in your fridge you are guaranteed a meal any time of the day. \n\n***\n### 2. Beans \nBeans are so flexible, you can use them in soups, in tacos, chilli, as a side or even with salads. They are a great source of fiber, protein, vitamin B and minerals.\n\nDried beans are usually cheaper than canned beans but cooking them can take at least 45 minutes. If you're trying to save time, you can buy canned beans and rinse them(to remove sodium) so you have healthy beans in minutes. \n\nBeans can make a meal more filling and they’re cheap; save money and eat healthier with beans.\n\n***\n### 3. Frozen Vegetables\nThe beauty of frozen vegetables is that they last longer without spoiling and they are usually cheaper. They are huge time savers too, no need to chop or wash.\n\nGreen beans, peas, broccoli, carrots, brussel sprouts, and corn are all flexible and can go along with breakfast, lunch or dinner meals. The store brands are usually cheaper than name brands and with the same ingredients.\n\n***\n### 4. Whole Chicken\nAnother flexible grocery item that you can use with tacos, burritos, salads, and pastas. A practical way is cooking chicken on the weekend and saving it in the refrigerator to use in different ways during the week. \n\nBuying a whole chicken is cheaper than a pre-cut chicken. You can learn online how to butcher a chicken in minutes with these video instructions:\n\n@[youtube](https://youtu.be/PEJSHRSJCn8) \n\n***\n\n### 5. Rice\nUse it to complete meals, mix it with vegetables, add it to chicken or to soup meals. It is  inexpensive, easy to prepare and can be quite filling. Not only that, you can make large amounts of rice and keep in the fridge for a few days. Fried rice is actually better if you use rice from the previous day.\n\nBrown rice is also a great option considering it’s high in fiber, has a bit of protein, and can help lower cholesterol. \n\n***\n\n### 6. Canned Fish\nCanned fish is a good source of protein that's available at a low price. Another benefit of canned fish is that you don't have to worry about using it within a day or two of buying it. Canned fish like salmon and tuna can be implemented in salads, pastas, and sandwiches. A great option for a quick and easy dinner.\n\n***\n\n### 7. Oatmeal\nOatmeal is a great breakfast option. It's incredibly cheap, it's filling, and it comes in different flavors. Buying a big tub of unsweetened and unflavored oatmeal can save you money. You can purchase any fruit that's on sale and flavor it yourself. Oatmeal is also a healthy option, a great source of fiber and protein.\n\n***\n\n### 8. Bananas\nBananas are some of the most inexpensive fruits and nutritious. They are rich in fiber and antioxidants. A lot of times, bananas are the best deal in the produce department. Bananas can be eaten sliced with oatmeal, as a snack, with cereal, or even banana pancakes. Check your local stores prices, sometimes you can get them at $0.19 cents each.\n\n***\n\n### 9. Frozen Spinach\nFrozen spinach is one of my favorite products because it’s cheaper than fresh spinach and it’s packed with all sorts of vitamins and minerals. Another great advantage of frozen spinach is that it lasts longer. It’s so convenient, it goes well with eggs, it can be added to stir-fries, to salads or even healthy smoothies full of nutrients. \n***\n### 10. Lentils\nLentils are really cheap, they can cost under $2 per pound. Lentils are packed with fiber, iron, and they have more protein than beef. They can last a long time without going bad Lentils can be added to salads, soups, and used as a side on any meal.\n***\n### Summary\n\nFood doesn't have to break the bank to provide numerous health benefits. Always keep healthy food options in mind, that way you save even more money by avoiding doctor visits and staying healthy.\n\nSo there you have it. I challenge you to eat healthy and save money!",

Scope of Fiction Services\n\n**1.1** The Fiction Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (\"Members\") and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are \"Hosts\" and the services they offer are \"Host Services\") to publish such Host Services on the Fiction Platform (\"Listings\") and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Host Services (Members using Host Services are \"Guests\"). Host Services may include the offering of properties for use (\"Accommodations\").\n\n**1.2** As the provider of the Fiction Platform, Fiction does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Host Services. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Fiction is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is Fiction a real estate broker or insurer. Fiction is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms.\n\n**1.3** While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, Fiction has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Fiction does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being \"verified\" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Fiction about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use other Host Services, accept a booking request from a Guest, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Verified Images (as defined below) are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by Fiction of any Host or Listing.\n\n**1.4** If you choose to use the Fiction Platform as a Host or Co-Host (as defined below), your relationship with Fiction is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Fiction for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of Fiction.\n\n**1.5** To promote the Fiction Platform and to increase the exposure of Listings to potential Guests, Listings and other Member Content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements. To assist Members who speak different languages, Listings and other Member Content may be translated, in whole or in part, into other languages. Fiction cannot guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of such translations. The Fiction Platform may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties for merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.\n\n**1.6** The Fiction Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (\"Third-Party Services\").

For example, we may allow Members associated with an Enterprise (as defined in our Privacy Policy) to book for other Members, or we may allow Hosts to add other Members as Co-Hosts (as defined below) to help manage their Listings. These features do not require that you share your credentials with any other person. No third party is authorized by Fiction to ask for your credentials, and you shall not request the credentials of another Member.\n\n## 5.

You are responsible for ensuring that your Host Service is accurately represented in the Verified Images and you will stop using the Verified Images on or through the Fiction Platform if they no longer accurately represent your Listing, if you stop hosting the Host Service featured, or if your Fiction Account is terminated or suspended for any reason. You acknowledge and agree that Fiction shall have the right to use any Verified Images in advertising, marketing and/or any other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation to you.

Fiction may, without prior notice, remove or disable access to any Member Content that Fiction finds to be in violation of these Terms or Fiction’s then-current Policies or Standards, or otherwise may be harmful or objectionable to Fiction, its Members, third parties, or property.\n\n**5.9** Fiction respects copyright law and expects its Members to do the same.

Except as otherwise provided on the Fiction Platform, Service Fees are non-refundable.\n\n## 7. Terms specific for Hosts\n\n**7.1** Terms applicable to all Listings\n\n**7.1.1** When creating a Listing through the Fiction Platform you must (i) provide complete and accurate information about your Host Service (such as listing description, location, and calendar availability), (ii) disclose any deficiencies, restrictions (such as house rules) and requirements that apply (such as any minimum age, proficiency or fitness requirements for an Experience) and (iii) provide any other pertinent information requested by Fiction. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) up-to-date at all times.\n\n**7.1.2** You are solely responsible for setting a price (including any Taxes if applicable) for your Listing (\"Listing Fee\"). Once a Guest requests a booking of your Listing, you may not request that the Guest pays a higher price than in the booking request.\n\n**7.1.3** Any terms and conditions included in your Listing, in particular in relation to cancellations, must not conflict with these Terms or the cancellation policy you have selected for your Listing.\n\n**7.1.4** Pictures, animations or videos (collectively, \"Images\") used in your Listings must accurately reflect the quality and condition of your Host Services. Fiction reserves the right to require that Listings have a minimum number of Images of a certain format, size and resolution.\n\n**7.1.5** The placement and ranking of Listings in search results on the Fiction Platform may vary and depend on a variety of factors, such as Guest search parameters and preferences, Host requirements, price and calendar availability, number and quality of Images, customer service and cancellation history, Reviews and Ratings, type of Host Service, and/or ease of booking.\n\n**7.1.6** When you accept or have pre-approved a booking request by a Guest, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with the Guest and are required to provide your Host Service(s) to the Guest as described in your Listing when the booking request is made. You also agree to pay the applicable Host Fee and any applicable Taxes, which will be collected pursuant to the Payments Terms.\n\n**7.1.7** Fiction recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Host Services. Please review any respective insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest has booked for, if applicable) while staying at your Accommodation or participating in your Experience, Event or other Host Service.\n\n**7.2** Listing Accommodations\n\n**7.2.1** You may only list one Accommodation per Listing.\n\n**7.2.2** If you choose to require a security deposit for your Accommodation, you must specify this in your Listing (\"Security Deposit\"). Hosts are not allowed to ask for a Security Deposit after a booking has been confirmed or outside of the Fiction Platform. Fiction will use commercially reasonable efforts to address Hosts’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Fiction is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Hosts related to Security Deposits.\n\n**7.2.3** You represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or a Guest's stay at, an Accommodation will (i) not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, such as homeowners association, condominium, or other agreements, and (ii) comply with all applicable laws (such as zoning laws), Tax requirements, and other rules and regulations (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations). As a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).\n\n## 8. Terms specific for Guests\n\n**8.1** Terms applicable to all bookings\n\n**8.1.1** Subject to meeting any requirements (such as completing any verification processes) set by the Host, you can book a Listing available on the Fiction Platform by following the respective booking process. All applicable fees, including the Listing Fee, Security Deposit (if applicable), Guest Fee and any applicable Taxes (collectively, \"Total Fees\") will be presented to you prior to booking a Listing. You agree to pay the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Fiction Account.\n\n**8.1.2** Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from Fiction, a legally binding agreement is formed between you and your Host, subject to any additional terms and conditions of the Host that apply, including in particular the applicable cancellation policy and any rules and restrictions specified in the Listing. Fiction Payments will collect the Total Fees at the time of the booking request or upon the Host’s confirmation pursuant to the Payments Terms.\n\n**8.1.3** If you book a Host Service on behalf of additional guests, you are required to ensure that every additional guest meets any requirements set by the Host, and is made aware of and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions, rules and restrictions set by the Host. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor, you represent and warrant that you are legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor. Minors may only participate in an Experience, Event or other Host Service if accompanied by an adult who is responsible for them.\n\n**8.2** Booking Accommodations\n\n**8.2.1** You understand that a confirmed booking of an Accommodation (\"Accommodation Booking\") is a limited license granted to you by the Host to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation for the duration of your stay, during which time the Host (only where and to the extent permitted by applicable law) retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation, in accordance with your agreement with the Host.\n\n**8.2.2** You agree to leave the Accommodation no later than the checkout time that the Host specifies in the Listing or such other time as mutually agreed upon between you and the Host. If you stay past the agreed upon checkout time without the Host's consent (\"Overstay\"), you no longer have a license to stay in the Accommodation and the Host is entitled to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law. In addition, you agree to pay, if requested by the Host, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay, an additional nightly fee of up to two (2) times the average nightly Listing Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Host, plus all applicable Guest Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Host to make you leave (collectively, \"Overstay Fees\"). Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Host as a result of such Overstay. Fiction Payments will collect Overstay Fees from you pursuant to the Payments Terms. A Security Deposit, if required by a Host, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for a Guest’s Overstay.\n\n## 9. Booking Modifications, Cancellations and Refunds, Resolution Tool\n\n**9.1** Hosts and Guests are responsible for any modifications to a booking that they make via the Fiction Platform or direct Fiction customer service to make (\"Booking Modifications\"), and agree to pay any additional Listing Fees, Host Fees or Guest Fees and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.\n\n**9.2** Guests can cancel a confirmed booking at any time subject to the Listing’s cancellation policy, and Fiction Payments will provide any refund to the Guest in accordance with such cancellation policy. Unless extenuating circumstances exist, any amounts due to the Host under the applicable cancellation policy will be remitted to the Host by Fiction Payments pursuant to the Payments Terms.\n\n**9.3** If a Host cancels a confirmed booking, the Guest will receive a full refund of the Total Fees for such booking and Fiction may publish an automated review on the Listing cancelled by the Host indicating that a booking was cancelled. In addition, Fiction may (i) keep the calendar for the Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, and/or (ii) impose a cancellation fee, unless the Host has a valid reason for cancelling the booking pursuant to Fiction’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy or has legitimate concerns about the Guest’s behavior.\n\n**9.4** In certain circumstances, Fiction may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking and make appropriate refund and payout decisions. This may be for reasons set forth in Fiction's Extenuating Circumstances Policy or (i) where Fiction believes in good faith, while taking the legitimate interests of both parties into account, this is necessary to avoid significant harm to Fiction, other Members, third parties or property, or (ii) for any of the reasons set out in these Terms.\n\n**9.5** If a Guest suffers a Travel Issue pursuant to the Guest Refund Policy, Fiction may determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Guest part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Guest Refund Policy.\n\n**9.6** Members may use the Resolution Tool to send or request money for refunds, additional Host Services, Co-Host Services or Damage Claims related to bookings. You agree to pay all amounts sent through the Resolution Tool in connection with your Fiction Account, and Fiction Payments will handle all such payments pursuant to the Payments Terms.\n\n## 10. Ratings and Reviews\n\n**10.1** Within a certain timeframe after completing a booking, Guests and Hosts can leave a public review (\"Review\") and submit a star rating (\"Rating\") about each other. Any Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinion of individual Members and do not reflect the opinion of Fiction. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by Fiction for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.\n\n**10.2** Ratings and Reviews by Guests and Hosts must be fair, truthful and factual and may not contain any offensive or defamatory language. Ratings and Reviews must comply with Fiction’s Content Policy and Extortion Policy.\n\n**10.3** Members are prohibited from manipulating the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner, such as instructing a third party write a positive or negative Review about another Member.\n\n## 11. Damage to Accommodations, Disputes between Members\n\n**11.1** As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation (including any personal or other property located at the Accommodation) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation, excluding the Host (and the individuals the Host invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).\n\n**11.2** If a Host claims and provides evidence that you as a Guest have damaged an Accommodation or any personal or other property at an Accommodation (\"Damage Claim\"), the Host can seek payment from you through the Resolution Tool. If a Host escalates a Damage Claim to Fiction, you will be given an opportunity to respond. If you agree to pay the Host, or Fiction determines in its sole discretion that you are responsible for the Damage Claim, Fiction Payments will collect any such sums from you and/or against the Security Deposit (if applicable) required to cover the Damage Claim pursuant to the Payments Terms. Fiction also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to Fiction in this regard in situations in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts under the Fiction Host Guarantee.\n\n**11.3** Members agree to cooperate with and assist Fiction in good faith, and to provide Fiction with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Fiction, in connection with any Damage Claims or other complaints or claims made by Members relating to Accommodations or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including, without limitation, payment requests made under the Fiction Host Guarantee), Experiences, or Co-Host agreements. A Member shall, upon Fiction's reasonable request and at no cost to the Member, participate in mediation or a similar resolution process with another Member, which process will be conducted by Fiction or a third party selected by Fiction or its insurer, with respect to losses for which a Member is requesting payment from Fiction (including but not limited to payments under the Fiction Host Guarantee).\n\n**11.4** If you are a Guest or a Co-Host, you understand and agree that Fiction may make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused, or been responsible for, to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by Fiction under the Fiction Host Guarantee). You agree to cooperate with and assist Fiction in good faith, and to provide Fiction with such information as may be reasonably requested by Fiction, to make a claim under your homeowner's, renter's or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Fiction may reasonably request to assist Fiction in accomplishing the foregoing.\n\n## 12. Rounding off, Currency conversion\n\n**12.1** Fiction may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable from or to Guests or Hosts to the nearest whole functional base unit in which the currency is denominated (i.e. to the nearest dollar, euro or other supported currency); for example, Fiction will round up an amount of $101.50 to $102.00, and round down an amount of $101.49 to $101.00. For currencies that are denominated in large numbers, Fiction may determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to be 10, 100 or 1,000 of the currency; for example, Fiction may round up an amount of 1,045 up to 1,050 and 1,044 down to 1,040, or 837,500 up to 838,000 and 837,499 down to 837,000.\n\n**12.2** The Fiction Platform facilitates bookings between Guests and Hosts who may prefer to pay in a currency different from their destination currency, which may require currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency preferences. Although the Fiction Platform allows Members to view the price of Listings in a number of currencies, the currencies available for Members to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the default currency in any given geographic location. Details regarding currency conversion, including any associated fees, are detailed in the Payments Terms.\n\n## 13. Taxes\n\n**13.1** As a Host you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your Listing Fees any applicable VAT or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy tax, tourist or other visitor taxes or income taxes (\"Taxes\").\n\n**13.2** Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Hosts, or to withhold Taxes from payouts to Hosts, or both. If a Host fails to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to freeze all payouts, withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both, until resolution.\n\n**13.3** You understand that any appropriate governmental agency, department and/or authority (\"Tax Authority\") where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Guests or Hosts on Listing Fees, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Hosts, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called \"transient occupancy taxes,\" \"hotel taxes,\" \"lodging taxes,\" \"city taxes,\" \"room taxes\" or \"tourist taxes\" (\"Occupancy Taxes\").\n\n**13.4** In certain jurisdictions, Fiction may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Guests or Hosts, in accordance these Terms (\"Collection and Remittance\") if such jurisdiction asserts Fiction or Hosts have an Occupancy Tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby instruct and authorize Fiction (via Fiction Payments) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Guests on the Host's behalf at the time Listing Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by Fiction will be visible to and separately stated to both Guests and Hosts on their respective transaction documents. Where Fiction is facilitating Collection and Remittance, Hosts are not permitted to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by Fiction relating to their Accommodations in that jurisdiction.\n\n**13.5** You agree that any claim or cause of action relating to Fiction's facilitation of Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by Fiction in connection with facilitation of Collection and Remittance, if any. Guests and Hosts agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by Fiction from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.\n\n**13.6** Fiction reserves the right, with prior notice to Hosts, to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction for any reason at which point Hosts and Guests are once again solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations in that jurisdiction.\n\n## 14. Prohibited Activities\n\n**14.1** You are solely responsible for compliance with any and all laws, rules, regulations, and Tax obligations that may apply to your use of the Fiction Platform. In connection with your use of the Fiction Platform, you will not and will not assist or enable others to:\n\n- breach or circumvent any applicable laws or regulations, agreements with third-parties, third-party rights, or our Terms, Policies or Standards;\n- use the Fiction Platform or Collective Content for any commercial or other purposes that are not expressly permitted by these Terms or in a manner that falsely implies Fiction endorsement, partnership or otherwise misleads others as to your affiliation with Fiction;\n- copy, store or otherwise access or use any information, including personally identifiable information about any other Member, contained on the Fiction Platform in any way that is inconsistent with Fiction’s Privacy Policy or these Terms or that otherwise violates the privacy rights of Members or third parties;\n- use the Fiction Platform in connection with the distribution of unsolicited commercial messages (\"spam\");\n- offer, as a Host, any Accommodation that you do not yourself own or have permission to make available as a residential or other property through the Fiction Platform;\n- unless Fiction explicitly permits otherwise, book any Listing if you will not actually be using the Host Services yourself;\n- contact another Member for any purpose other than asking a question related to a your own booking, Listing, or the Member's use of the Fiction Platform, including, but not limited to, recruiting or otherwise soliciting any Member to join third-party services, applications or websites, without our prior written approval;\n- use the Fiction Platform to request, make or accept a booking independent of the Fiction Platform, to circumvent any Service Fees or for any other reason;\n- request, accept or make any payment for Listing Fees outside of the Fiction Platform or Fiction Payments.

Members agree to cooperate with and assist Fiction in good faith, and to provide Fiction with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Fiction with respect to any investigation undertaken by Fiction or a representative of Fiction regarding the use or abuse of the Fiction Platform.\n\n**14.3** If you feel that any Member you interact with, whether online or in person, is acting or has acted inappropriately, including but not limited to anyone who (i) engages in offensive, violent or sexually inappropriate behavior, (ii) you suspect of stealing from you, or (iii) engages in any other disturbing conduct, you should immediately report such person to the appropriate authorities and then to Fiction by contacting us with your police station and report number (if available); provided that your report will not obligate us to take any action beyond that required by law (if any) or cause us to incur any liability to you.\n\n## 15. Term and Termination, Suspension and other Measures\n\n**15.1** This Agreement shall be effective for a 30-day term, at the end of which it will automatically and continuously renew for subsequent 30-day terms until such time when you or Fiction terminate the Agreement in accordance with this provision.\n\n**15.2** You may terminate this Agreement at any time via the \"Cancel Account\" feature on the Fiction Platform or by sending us an email. If you cancel your Fiction Account as a Host, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and your Guests will receive a full refund. If you cancel your Fiction Account as a Guest, any confirmed booking(s) will be automatically cancelled and any refund will depend upon the terms of the Listing’s cancellation policy.\n\n**15.3** Without limiting our rights specified below, Fiction may terminate this Agreement for convenience at any time by giving you thirty (30) days' notice via email to your registered email address.\n\n**15.4** Fiction may immediately, without notice terminate this Agreement if (i) you have materially breached your obligations under these Terms, the Payments Terms, our Policies or Standards, (ii) you have violated applicable laws, regulations or third party rights, or (iii) Fiction believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of Fiction, its Members, or third parties (for example in the case of fraudulent behavior of a Member).\n\n**15.5** In addition, Fiction may take any of the following measures (i) to comply with applicable law, or the order or request of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body, or if (ii) you have breached these Terms, the Payments Terms, our Policies or Standards, applicable laws, regulations, or third party rights, (iii) you have provided inaccurate, fraudulent, outdated or incomplete information during the Fiction Account registration, Listing process or thereafter, (iv) you and/or your Listings or Host Services at any time fail to meet any applicable quality or eligibility criteria, (v) you have repeatedly received poor Ratings or Reviews or Fiction otherwise becomes aware of or has received complaints about your performance or conduct, (vi) you have repeatedly cancelled confirmed bookings or failed to respond to booking requests without a valid reason, or (vii) Fiction believes in good faith that such action is reasonably necessary to protect the personal safety or property of Fiction, its Members, or third parties, or to prevent fraud or other illegal activity:\n\n- refuse to surface, delete or delay any Listings, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content;\n- cancel any pending or confirmed bookings;\n- limit your access to or use of the Fiction Platform;\n- temporarily or permanently revoke any special status associated with your Fiction Account; or\n- temporarily or in case of severe or repeated offenses permanently suspend your Fiction Account.\n\nIn case of non-material breaches and where appropriate, you will be given notice of any intended measure by Fiction and an opportunity to resolve the issue to Fiction's reasonable satisfaction.\n\n**15.6** If we take any of the measures described above (i) we may refund your Guests in full for any and all confirmed bookings that have been cancelled, irrespective of preexisting cancellation policies, and (ii) you will not be entitled to any compensation for pending or confirmed bookings that were cancelled.\n\n**15.7** When this Agreement has been terminated, you are not entitled to a restoration of your Fiction Account or any of your Member Content. If your access to or use of the Fiction Platform has been limited or your Fiction Account has been suspended or this Agreement has been terminated by us, you may not register a new Fiction Account or access and use the Fiction Platform through an Fiction Account of another Member.\n\n**15.8** Unless you reside in Germany, if you or we terminate this Agreement, the clauses of these Terms that reasonably should survive termination of the Agreement will remain in effect.\n\n## 16. Disclaimers\n\nIf you choose to use the Fiction Platform or Collective Content, you do so voluntarily and at your sole risk. The Fiction Platform and Collective Content is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, either express or implied.\n\nYou agree that you have had whatever opportunity you deem necessary to investigate the Fiction Services, laws, rules, or regulations that may be applicable to your Listings and/or Host Services you are receiving and that you are not relying upon any statement of law or fact made by Fiction relating to a Listing.\n\nIf we choose to conduct identity verification or background checks on any Member, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that such checks will identify prior misconduct by a Member or guarantee that a Member will not engage in misconduct in the future.\n\nYou agree that some Experiences, Events or other Host Services may carry inherent risk, and by participating in those Host Services, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily. For example, some Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your participation in a Host Service. If you are bringing a minor as an additional guest, you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor throughout the duration of your Host Service and to the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to release and hold harmless Fiction from all liabilities and claims that arise in any way from any injury, death, loss or harm that occurs to that minor during the Host Service or in any way related to your Host Service.\n\nThe foregoing disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. You may have other statutory rights. However, the duration of statutorily required warranties, if any, shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\n## 17. Liability\n\n**17.1** Unless you reside in the EU, you acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Fiction Platform and Collective Content, your publishing or booking of any Listing via the Fiction Platform, your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience or Event or use of any other Host Service or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online remains with you. Neither Fiction nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Fiction Platform or Collective Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) from the use of or inability to use the Fiction Platform or Collective Content, (iii) from any communications, interactions or meetings with other Members or other persons with whom you communicate, interact or meet with as a result of your use of the Fiction Platform, or (iv) from your publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of a Listing’s Host Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not Fiction has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Except for our obligations to pay amounts to applicable Hosts pursuant to these Terms or an approved payment request under the Fiction Host Guarantee, in no event will Fiction’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms and your use of the Fiction Platform including, but not limited to, from your publishing or booking of any Listings via the Fiction Platform, or from the use of or inability to use the Fiction Platform or Collective Content and in connection with any Accommodation, Experiences, Event or other Host Service, or interactions with any other Members, exceed the amounts you have paid or owe for bookings via the Fiction Platform as a Guest in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or if you are a Host, the amounts paid by Fiction to you in the twelve (12) month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100), if no such payments have been made, as applicable. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Fiction and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S., this does not affect Fiction’s liability for death or personal injury arising from its negligence, nor for fraudulent misrepresentation, misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter or any other liability which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.\n\n**17.2** If you reside in the EU, Fiction is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health. Fiction is liable for any negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents. Essential contractual obligations are such duties of Fiction in whose proper fulfilment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract but the amount shall be limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damage. Any additional liability of Fiction is excluded.\n\n## 18. Indemnification\n\nYou agree to release, defend (at Fiction’s option), indemnify, and hold Fiction and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach of these Terms or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the Fiction Platform or any Fiction Services, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Accommodation, participation in an Experience, Event or other Host Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation or use, (iv) Fiction’s Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights.\n\n## 19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement\n\n**19.1** This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United States; or (ii) do not reside in the United States, but bring any claim against Fiction in the United States (to the extent not in conflict with Section 21).\n\n**19.2** Overview of Dispute Resolution Process. Fiction is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section **19.1** applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Fiction’s customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section 19). Specifically, the process provides:\n\nClaims can be filed with AAA online (www.adr.org);\nArbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;\nArbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;\nParties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;\nThe initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;\nThe consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;\nThe arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.\n\n**19.3** Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Fiction each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact Fiction’s customer service team by emailing us. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.\n\n**19.4** Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Fiction mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the Fiction Platform, the Host Services, or the Collective Content (collectively, \"Disputes\") will be settled by binding arbitration (the \"Arbitration Agreement\"). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Fiction agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.\n\n**19.5** Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement. You and Fiction each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).\n\n**19.6** Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.\n\n**19.7** Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Fiction agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in Salt Lake City County; (c) in any other location to which you and Fiction both agree; (d) via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.\n\n**19.8** Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, Fiction agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\n\n**19.9** Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.\n\n**19.10** Jury Trial Waiver. You and Fiction acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.\n\n**19.11** No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings. You and Fiction acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and Fiction both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.\n\n**19.12** Severability. Except as provided in Section **19.11**, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.\n\n**19.13** Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (\"Modification of these Terms\"), if Fiction changes this Section 19 (\"Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement\") after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \"Last Updated\" date above or in the date of Fiction’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Fiction in accordance with the provisions of the \"Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement\" section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\n\n**19.14** Survival. Except as provided in Section **19.12** and subject to Section 15.8, this Section 19 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Fiction Platform or terminate your Fiction Account.\n\n## 20. Feedback\n\nWe welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Fiction Platform (\"Feedback\"). You may submit Feedback by emailing us, through the \"Contact\" section of the Fiction Platform, or by other means of communication. Any Feedback you submit to us will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.\n\n## 21. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction\n\n21.1 If you reside in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 19 must be brought in state or federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n21.2 If you reside in China these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of China (\"China Laws\"). Any dispute arising from or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) for arbitration in Beijing which shall be conducted in accordance with CIETAC’s arbitration rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration, provided that this section shall not be construed to limit any rights which Fiction may have to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring you to perform or be prohibited from performing certain acts and other provisional relief permitted under China Laws or any other laws that may apply to you. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English. The arbitral award rendered is final and binding upon both parties.\n\n21.3 If you reside outside of the United States and China, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with Irish law. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded. The choice of law does not impact your rights as a consumer according to the consumer protection regulations of your country of residence. If you are acting as a consumer, you agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts. Judicial proceedings that you are able to bring against us arising from or in connection with these Terms may only be brought in a court located in Ireland or a court with jurisdiction in your place of residence. If Fiction wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident. If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.\n\n## 22. General Provisions\n\n**22.1** Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines or standards, these Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Fiction and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Fiction and you in relation to the access to and use of the Fiction Platform.\n\n**22.2** No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Fiction as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Fiction Platform.\n\n**22.3** These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.\n\n**22.4** If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.\n\n**22.5** Fiction’s failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise permitted under law.\n\n**22.6** You may not assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without Fiction's prior written consent. Fiction may without restriction assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior notice. Your right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains unaffected.\n\n**22.7** Unless specified otherwise, any notices or other communications to Members permitted or required under this Agreement, will be in writing and given by Fiction via email, Fiction Platform notification, or messaging service (including SMS and WeChat). For notices made to Members residing outside of Germany, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which Fiction transmits the notice.\n\n**22.8** If you reside in the EU you can access the European Commission’s online dispute resolution platform here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. Please note that Fiction is not committed nor obliged to use an alternative dispute resolution entity to resolve disputes with consumers.\n\n**22.9** If you have any questions about these Terms please [email](mailto:hello@fiction.com) us.",

    "content": "This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and disclose your information across the Fiction Platform.\n\nIf you see an undefined term in this Privacy Policy (such as \"Listing\" or \"Fiction Platform\"), it has the same definition as outlined in our Terms of Service.\n\nWhen this policy mentions \"Fiction,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our,\" it refers to the Fiction company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the \"Data Controller\").\n\n## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT\n\nThere are three general categories of information we collect.\n\n**1.1** Information You Give Us.\n\nWe collect information you share with us when you use the Fiction Platform.\n\n- Account Information. When you sign up for an Fiction Account, we require certain information such as your name, email address, and date of birth.\n- Profile Information. To use certain features within the Fiction Platform, we may also ask you to complete a profile, which may include your address, phone number, and gender. Certain parts of your profile (like your profile picture, first name, and description) are a part of your public profile page, and will be publicly visible to others.\n- Other Authentication-Related Information. To help create and maintain a trusted environment, we may collect identification (like a photo of your government-issued ID) or other authentication information. To learn more, see our Help Center article about providing identification on Fiction.\n- Payment Information. We collect your financial information (like your bank account or credit card information) when you use the Payment Services to process payments.\n- Communications with Fiction and other Members. When you communicate with Fiction or use the Fiction Platform to communicate with other Members, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.\n- Address Book Contact Information. You may choose to import your address book contacts or enter your contacts’ information manually to access certain features of the Fiction Platform, like inviting them to use Fiction.\n- Other Information. You may otherwise choose to provide us information when you fill in a form, conduct a search, update or add information to your Fiction Account, respond to surveys, post to community forums, participate in promotions, or use other features of the Fiction Platform.\n\n**1.2** Information We Automatically Collect from Your Use of the Fiction Platform.\n\nWhen you use the Fiction Platform, we collect information about the services you use and how you use them.\n\n- Usage Information. We collect information about your interactions with the Fiction Platform, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches for Listings, bookings you have made, and other actions on the Fiction Platform.\n- Location Information. When you use certain features of the Fiction Platform, we may collect different types of information about your general location (e.g. IP address, zip code) or more specific location information (e.g. precise location from your mobile GPS). Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services for applications in the device’s settings menu.\n- Log Data. We automatically collect log information when you use the Fiction Platform, even if you have not created an Fiction Account or logged in. That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Fiction Platform (including links to third party applications), IP address, access times, hardware and software information, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type), and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before or after using the Fiction Platform.\n- Transaction Information. We collect information related to your transactions on the Fiction Platform, including the date and time, amounts charged, and other related transaction details.\n- Cookies and Similar Technologies. We use cookies and other similar technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, and mobile identifiers. We may also allow our business partners to use these tracking technologies on the Fiction Platform, or engage others to track your behavior on our behalf. While you may disable the usage of cookies through your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a \"Do Not Track\" signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application. For more information on our use of these technologies, see our Cookie Policy.\n\n**1.3** Information We Collect from Third Parties.\n\nWe may collect information that others provide about you when they use the Fiction Platform, or obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through the Fiction Platform.\n\n- Third Party Services. If you link, connect, or login to your Fiction Account with a third party service (e.g., Facebook, WeChat), the third party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. This information varies and is controlled by that service or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service.\n- Your References. If someone has written a reference for you, it will be published on your Fiction public profile page. To learn more about how this works, see our Help Center article about References.\n- Background Information. For Members in the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, Fiction may obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations. For Members outside of the United States, to the extent permitted by applicable laws, Fiction may obtain the local version of background or registered sex offender checks. We may use your information, including your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports.\n- Other Sources. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data or fraud detection information, from third party service providers and/or partners, and combine it with information we have about you. For example, we may receive background check results or fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification services for our fraud prevention and risk assessment efforts. We may receive information about you and your activities on and off the Fiction Platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.\n\n## 2.

For example:\n\n- Parts of your public profile page, such as your first name, your description, and city, are publicly visible to others.\n- Public Listing pages are publicly visible and include information such as the Accommodation or Experience’s approximate location (neighborhood and city), Listing description, calendar availability, the Host public profile photo, aggregated demand information (like page views over a period of time), and any additional information the Host chooses to share.\n- After completing a booking, Guests and Hosts may write reviews and rate each other. Reviews are a part of your public profile page.\n- If you submit content in a public forum or social media post, or use a similar feature on the Fiction Platform, that content is publicly visible.\n\nInformation you share publicly on the Fiction Platform may be indexed through third party search engines. In some cases, you may opt-out of this feature in your Account settings. If you change your settings or your public-facing content, these search engines may not update their databases. We do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information.\n\n**3.4** Service Providers.\n\nWe use a variety of third party service providers to help us provide services related to the Fiction Platform. Service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"). For example, service providers may help us: (i) verify or authenticate your identification, (ii) check information against public databases, (iii) assist us with background checks, fraud prevention, and risk assessment, or (iv) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services. These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually obligated to use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\n**3.5** Additional Services by Hosts.\n\nHosts may use third party services available through the Fiction Platform to assist with managing their Accommodation or providing additional services, such as cleaning services or lock providers. Hosts may use features on the Fiction Platform to share information about the Guest (like check-in and check-out dates, Guest name, Guest phone number, and Guest anonymized email address) with that third party service provider for the purposes of coordinating the stay, managing the Accommodation, or delivering other services.\n\n**3.6** Fiction Payments.\n\nFiction Payments may share your personal information to: (i) provide the Payment Services, (ii) facilitate your use of the Fiction Platform, and (iii) jointly market products or services to you with other financial third parties with whom Fiction Payments has a formal agreement. You can unsubscribe or opt-out from receiving such marketing communications in your Account settings.\n\n**3.7** Safety and Compliance with Law.\n\nFiction may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required to do so by law or if such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with legal process and to respond to claims asserted against Fiction, (ii) to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal liability, (iii) to enforce and administer our Terms of Service or other agreements with Members, (iv) for fraud investigation and prevention, risk assessment, customer support, product development and debugging purposes, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Fiction, its employees, its Members, or members of the public.\n\nWe will attempt to notify Members about these requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Fiction’s property, its Members and the Platform (collectively, \"Risk Scenarios\"). In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that Member about the request after the fact if we determine in good faith that we are no longer legally prohibited from doing so and that no Risk Scenarios apply.\n\n**3.8** Corporate Affiliates.\n\nTo help us provide the Fiction Platform, we may share your information within our corporate family of companies (both financial and non-financial entities) that are related by common ownership or control.

Typically, this includes your name, dates of the booking, number of guests, pricing, Listing details, the Accommodation address, and other related information. At the request of your Enterprise, we may also disclose this information to service providers engaged by it, such as companies that provide travel management, financial reporting, personnel management, crisis management, or other services. In the event of a dispute, emergency, or similar situation involving a booking identified as being for business purposes, Fiction may also share relevant information it believes is necessary to safely and quickly address the situation.\n\n**3.13** Business Transfers.\n\nIf Fiction undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information. In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n\n**3.14** Aggregated Data.\n\nWe may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and non-personally identifiable information for industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.\n\n## 4. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\n**4.1** Analyzing your Communications.\n\nWe may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Fiction Platform for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other websites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. However, occasionally we may need to manually review some communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your communications to send third party marketing messages to you, and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.\n\n**4.2** Linking Third Party Accounts.\n\nYou may link your Fiction Account with your account at a third party social networking service. Your contacts on these third party services are referred to as \"Friends.\" When you create this link:\n\n- some of the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be published on your Fiction Account profile;\n- your activities on the Fiction Platform may be displayed to your Friends on the Fiction Platform and/or that third party site;\n- a link to your public profile on that third party social networking service may be included in your Fiction public profile;\n- other Fiction users may be able to see any common Friends that you may have with them, or that you are a Friend of their Friend if applicable;\n- other Fiction users may be able to see any schools, hometowns or other groups you have in common with them as listed on your linked social networking service;\n- the information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes; and\n- the publication and display of information that you provide to Fiction through this linkage is subject to your settings and authorizations on the Fiction Platform and the third party site.\n\n**4.3** Google Maps/Earth.\n\nParts of the Fiction Platform use Google Maps/Earth services, including the Google Maps API(s).

          "content": "Overcoming obstacles, persevering through tough times, and maintaining passion for long-term goals is what sets successful people apart from the crowd.\n\nAnd while you might know that persistence is important, not everyone knows why. \n\nThe reason is because failure is a critical step in success. Messing up is human, but we only learn and improve from the mistakes we make. So, giving up early makes you lose the opportunity to learn from your mistakes. Which means you miss the important part: what you need to do to succeed.\n\n### Celebrate Failure, It Means You Took Action\n\nHave you ever heard about ostriches burying their head in the sand? Well actually, they don’t do that. They dig holes in the ground to use as nests for their eggs. \n\nBut strangely, humans do this all the time. Our first instinct is to close their mind, ignore, blow-off something if we're not confident in its success. \n\nFor example, you might want to write an article a day. But instead, you just read about writing.  You might want to start a company, but just watch videos about it on Youtube. Ultimately, you're afraid of putting something out there; because it inevitably means risking failure. \n\nThe thing you need to know is failure, real failure, is the first step on the path to success.\n\nFailure (done right) is going to teach you exactly what you need to create, learn, do, become, etc.. \n\n**So How Does One Fail \"Right?\"**\n\nElon Musk’s first SpaceX launch failed 33 seconds after lift off due to a rusty nut back in 2006. SpaceX failed four more times between 2007 and 2016, but Musk didn’t give up, his team's persistence and failure-based improvements allowed them to succeed. In March 2017, SpaceX successfully launched a used rocket for the first time and the rest is history. SpaceX plans to send astronauts to the International Space Station in June 2019.\n\n### Efficient Repetition\nIf you want to master something, you must focus on repetition, not perfection. \n\nYour product has to be great and making a great product takes repetition. Having a high pain threshold is also necessary since pain and failure are part of the process. But make sure your activity is shaped like an upward spiral not like a dog chasing its tail, your repetition must include improvements.\n\n![Repetition Must Include Improvements](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjsfbx0tn%2Fpersistence.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=0c00056a-b771-440a-a756-4d7930c28240)\n\nThe more you repeat an activity, the more your brain becomes efficient at that activity and eventually the actions become automatic behavior. \n\n> Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. - Henry Ford\n\nIt’s easy to find successful people who focused on repetition and improvement like Thomas Edison. It took him more than 1,000 attempts before inventing the “first” light bulb. By the time Edison started working on it, the light bulb had been around for a while but in a different form and not as efficient. \n\nEdison’s persistency allowed him to test different materials, their duration efficiency and their cost to develop the first practical incandescent lighting system. He even invented the way light bulbs get screwed into sockets, his contribution to the perfection of the light bulb is impressive.\n\n### Seek Constant Criticism\n\nA lot of times, when you speculate instead of seeking criticism, you tend to waste months of work going the wrong direction, or switching between ideas because of your own thinking. \n\nCustomer feedback helps you avoid this, it saves you time and allows you to persist on valuable items. It helps you improve your product or services, and allows you to learn.\n\n> A well thought out critique of whatever you’re doing is as valuable as gold. -Elon Musk\n\nFor example, Henry Ford's first batch of the Model A’s had many issues. He had so many problems that the Ford Motor Company had to send mechanics to fix cars. But when these mechanics came back, they came back with feedback. This feedback allowed Ford to implement fixes in his assembly line. They kept selling, shipping and the company kept learning. \n\nIt would take Ford 5 more years of failures, repetition, and criticism before dominating the market with the model T. His persistence and improvements made him successful.\n\n\n### Summary\n\nHopefully the above principles help you avoid mistakes while staying persistent and guide you on the path to success.\n\n* Failure is the first step on the path to success.\n* Focus on repetition, not perfection.\n* Seek constant criticism.",

    "content": "In 44 BC, in the midst of the Great Roman Civil War, a writer named Cicero set to write what would become one of the most influential books in human history. He wrote this book in only 4 weeks, and would be assassinated by his enemies just a few months later. \n\nThis book, named “[On Duties](https://www.amazon.com/Cicero-Cambridge-History-Political-Thought/dp/0521348358/)” (*latin: de officiis*) was about the responsibilities citizens have in a society.  The reasons for this books importance are varied but it’s not an exaggeration to say that it was the intellectual underwriting for the renaissance and the aspirational blueprint for the founding fathers of America (as it was known as a primary influence of humanist philosophers). \n\nWhat was the trick that Cicero used to write so powerfully and influentially?  Was it his intelligence and insight? Well… yes, but not in the way you think. See, Cicero might be one of the first research based writers. Most of Cicero’s ideas are simply latin articulations of ideas from ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, or the stoics. \n\n> No one will ever write anything more wise -- Voltaire (about De Officiis)\n\nCicero established that research is the most important component in writing. Because interesting and new information is what makes writing valuable. And the goal of any good writing is to be valuable to your reader.\n\nSo how do you write well in 2020? Cicero’s research based approach works just as well today as it did back then. Here’s a few tips\n\n\n## Cicero’s Method\n\n### 60% of the time on the outline\n\nThe best writing changes the reader’s perspective of the world. It is not writing for writing sake or about demonstrating your knowledge about a subject. (this is the opposite of what is taught in school- but teacher’s only read your writing because they are paid to and care little about getting value from the writing of their students)\n\nTo change people’s perspectives you need to bring them new arguments or information, and you need to articulate it well. You do this solely through the outline you write BEFORE you write anything else.  That’s why it’s safe to say that a majority of your time writing should actually be spent writing (and doing the research for) the outline. \n\n### Start With Your Readers Problem\n\nYour readers are looking to understand something better. They are looking for insights or context to build their understanding. Thats why its best to start articles directly or indirectly with a summary of the problem your target reader is facing. \n\nYou might lead with a story or anecdote but first, tie this back to the problem or issue that you will address later with solutions (or tips)\n\n### Don't try a \"be original\".. *i.e. copy*\n\nAspire to bring original value, not original writing. Do this by articulating the ideas of others in new ways or formats. Don't waste time trying to invent new words or phrases.\n\nDid you know that the Declaration of Independence wasn’t original? The [Virginia Declaration of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights) uses much of the same language and was published only a few days before Thomas Jefferson began writing it.  \n\nSo go ahead and emulate someone else. If one of the most celebrated documents in history is copied, then you don’t need to worry about it.\n\n### 3 Non-Typical and Concrete Details\n\nThe difference between a well written blog post and a bad one, can usually be defined by the amount of concrete details mentioned in it. Ever tried Googling something and gotten a ton of low quality answers, seemingly with little to no insight? Well, writers on content farms are typically paid by the article, what they do is step 1. Google the subject 2. Regurgitate the information they find into an article. That’s why most articles are useless.  It’s just the same information written and rewritten. \n\nSo I recommend you find at least 3 concrete details to add to any article you write. If you do that, you’ll have a good chance of adding something interesting that people haven’t heard before. \n\n### Template \nIf you've gotten this far, I've included a link the outline I used to write this very article.  You can find it here: [blog writing outline example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1liAPiot_KVxnIOdonjzC6_vLa_uKG8qWw8k7v7oK2FQ/edit).\n\n### Summary\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjsjhx0af%2Fsummary.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=d0e600f7-b65b-486a-b200-5ae2c4a0a280)\n\nIf you’d like  to write better you should focus on your research and outline process; not the writing itself. \n\nSome tools to help you with that are: \n\n1. Spend 60% of the time writing on the outline. This will help you be interesting and communicate.\n1. Start with a conversation around the problem of your readers. All good writing exists to solve a problem of some kind. \n1. Avoid the desire to be completely “original.” There is no such thing as original writing, so to write well emulate someone else and endeavor to articulate ideas in new ways rather than write differently. \n1. Find at least 3 non-typical and concrete examples. Bringing new details will make the writing more interesting and ensure readers are likely to walk away with new information if nothing else",

    "content": "In 1961, Jean Nidetch weighed 214 pounds and was struggling with losing weight. She tried fasting, eating nothing but eggs and grapefruit, mixing oil and evaporated milk and drinking it three times a day. She’d drop pounds and then gain it back, often more.\n\nOf course, Jean realized that the ultimate problem wasn't the food it was her lack of self-discipline. Knowing this, she resolved to solve her weight issue once and for all. \n\nShe joined a free 10-week weight-loss program put on by an obesity clinic. The program was called the \"Prudent Diet\" and relied on a strict multi-disciplinary diet, in an almost fascist style. While she lost 20 lbs, she knew it wasn't sustainable. \n\nSo, Jean started a weekly meeting with friends to go over the aspects of the \"prudent diet\" along with what became an amazing innovation: weekly weight measurement and discussion about the results. \n\nThis idea, what I call \"competitive measurement\" became the key insight to Jean's company Weight Watchers, which went public only two years later. \n\nWhy did this work so well for Jean and her friends? The answer lies in psychology...\n\n## Why Measurement Means Results\n\nWhat is it about measurement that makes it so powerful?  \n\nThe answer lies in way your brain works. Humans are highly evolved to build habits, and scientists have shown that the pattern for creating habits is almost 100% a result of the cue and the reward. \n\nWith weight, the positive rewards are far from immediate while the pains of hunger are an unrelenting daily pressure. Thats why your brain does a poor job of connecting the habit of dieting with the reward of looking (and feeling) good. Your animal brain just asks, why are you making me hungry?? \n\nNow, introduce competitive measurement. When you measure the positive *behaviors* you are looking for, it then becomes easy to put these performance of these behaviors on a chart. For example, if you'd like to write every day, you would simply put the words/page on a daily chart and graph it. \n\nThis chart then becomes a form of feedback and reward; which is much better than the alternative, which is nothing. \n\n![Habit, Competition and Measurement](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjslxnwb3%2Fhabit-loop.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=8499b9b3-33a3-46dc-a174-4e013a5c1378)\n\n## Your Competitive Psychology and Discipline\n\nWhile measurement alone can work wonders, adding the element of competition puts things into overdrive. Adding this element takes the \"intrinsic\" motive of just wanting to do better and adds the necessary \"extrinsic\" element that forces you to follow up. People don't want to \"lose.\"\n\nIt's well known that Apple figured this out and competitive fitness is actually the key feature implemented into the fitness focused Apple Watch. \n\n\n### Conclusion: Tools for Measuring Your Life\n\nIf you'd like the get better, the trick is to get started measuring your behavior. I personally use Google Sheets and some custom templates I've built to do this. \n\nTools like Automate.io and Zapier can insert rows into my worksheets. Thing like my computer productivity with (RescueTime), running performance (Strava), etc. go in there and then I chart them and use Google Apps to email my charts daily. \n\nIn coming articles, I'll add more specifics about the nuts and bolts of my quantitive self (QS) tools and techniques.",

    "content": "*Remote work is a challenge to maintain and manage. The key is using a 3-person \"hub model\" which solves the quality and culture problems while still allowing people to be location independant.*\n\nIn 1758, The Way to Wealth, was printed by Poor Richard, otherwise known as Ben Franklin. In this book, Franklin describes many of the maxims for managing money and people. \n\nWhile today many things are different, one thing hasn't changed: managing people is hard. And if you want to do it remotely, well, then its even harder. \n\nFranklin has a quote I find relevant: \n\n> Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge. Not to oversee workmen is to leave them your purse open. Trusting too much in the others care is the ruin of many. For in the affairs of this world men are saved, not by faith, but by the want of it. \n\nAnd in the case of remote work, managing people from afar, we have the above scenario only multiplied exponentially. \n\nSo how does one effectively conduct business in a remote environment? For that, I'd like to introduce the \"Hub Model,\" but first let's discuss the problems...\n\n## The Problems in Remote Based Companies\n\nIn my first company, [PageLines](https://www.pagelines.com), I ran the company completely remote. Although that wasn't always the intention. Working from San Francisco, I quickly discoved the most difficult (and expensive) place to hire competent talent and to keep them focused. \n\nIn this environment, I made every mistake, the first of which was drinking the Koolaid about being \"remote\" without considering all the caveats regarding implementation and sanity. Anyway, some of the problems I faced: \n\n- **Quality Control** - Keeping the quality of implementation to an exacting standard is nearly impossible in a purely remote company. (That's why you rarely see a remote business that makes you admire the brilliance of their execution.)\n\n- **Communication Overhead** - In remote companies, if you want any chance, you need to spend somewhere along the lines of 3x more time on communication. This can be a huge dent to overall productivity.\n\n- **Missed Expectations, Frustration and Bottlenecks** - Something that seems to happen in the remote environment, due to a lack of quality feedback, is missed expectations. Often time the initial meetings don't tell the whole story and the remote worker than delivers something a few days later that is way of the mark. \n\nAlso, the tools don't work. Slack, Teamspeak, whatever, they all just lead to more distractions than help. People start to think \"working\" is just saying \"Hey guys!\" on Slack -- (even though they are super hungover and at the pool.)\n\nThese are the main problems, and as you likely know, managing things in a remote work environment comes with some nice advantages. Namely, costs for talent, a larget talent pool and a better lifestyle for everyone. \n\nSo how to we rectify these things and maximize our results? Yep the Hub Model!\n\n## The Remote Hub Model\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjsp0son8%2Fhub-model-world.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=71bf1442-5ac7-4199-aa0e-ed50e6da373e)\n\nThe hub model is simple and is based somewhat on the 3-person idea that [37Signals often evangelizes](https://m.signalvnoise.com/threes-company/). \n\n**The idea is this:** \n- 3 People Rule - Allow remote work but only in teams of 3 people or more. \n- Time Chunk Rule - Set up company wide time chunks that allow teams to sync up. i.e. \"this quarter lets all work from Sweden.\"\n- Together Rule - The team must spend working hours together in a coworking location at the location\n\nOk, so if we have three people, isn't that like opening an office somewhere? No! The difference is that an \"office\" is permanent a \"remote hub\" moves with the team. This team of three people can work from wherever they want, basically the office moves and the team that goes there is interchangeable on a monthly or quarterly basis.\n\nLet's say for example that we have a 15 person agency. One person would like to go check out Argentina for a month, well then just allow the employee to slot the time and recruit at least two others that want to try it as well. \n\n## Conclusion: Why Does This Work? \n\nManaging a remote team is impossible if done incorrectly and difficult even if you try super hard. Thats why you should try the Hub Model. \n\nThe hub model works because people need to work together. It solves the problems in the following way: \n\n- Quality - A team working together will give each other feedback and drive each other towards better results. \n- Communication - Teams have less of a need for communication since they mostly will communicate amongst themselves and report weekly. \n- Missed Expectations - Its harder for a team to miss expectations than a hungover individual.\n\nYet all the benefits of the remote environment remain. See? Hopefully we learned something today =D",

Not giving too much information, the right details at the right moment. \n\nThe goal is to hook the readers into the story and help them get an idea of what's to come.\n\nIn the same way, you need to finesse your new users. First, just like the beginning pages of a book, you 'hook' them with your tagline/headline.  But this is just a tease that lets them know \"this product is for me. \"\n\n\n\n#### Step 2) Character Development: Introduce Your Features\n\nOnce you've hooked your readers, the next thing a good author does is move to initial character development. \n\nWith onboarding, this is where you introduce your key features and how they relate to your users goals, etc. \n\nAt Fiction, we follow this process: \n\n- Identify the 3 key features that help new users \"get it\"\n\n- Create three panels (seen directly after signup) that walk the users through the process of setting up these three things\n\n- Congratulate the users on their accomplishment (from here we can move to Step 3)\n\n   \n\n#### Step 3) The Plot: Demonstrate Value\n\n- Setup - talk about how a plot is where the rubber the meets pavement.  Now its time to demonstrate value with follow up emails and comms. \n- Use the results of step 2, to both articulate value and to encourage further engagement into your \"story\"\n\n\n\n#### Summary\n\nAt first it's hard to understand the right onboarding approach. But mentally it helps if you realize its just story writing. \n\nSome of the biggest product growth comes from refining your product story.\n\nIt could be as minimal as changing the hook or showing the right features… but once it clicks, growth occurs.",

    "content": "**This is a technical post, mostly to serve as a time saver to other people with the same question as me: \"How do you manage related public and private repositories while still using a monorepo?\"**\n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjsum7bcb%2Fyarn-workflow-logo.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=a116e722-87a7-41f3-b4ae-dbc96e0fafc2)\n\nBehind the scenes here at Fiction, we're working on a [new CMS tool](https://www.fiction.com/factor) which we are hoping to open-source at some point. To do this, we want to purse a monorepo setup, for [various reasons](https://danluu.com/monorepo/) that I won't get into here. \n\nI ran into a problem that seemed to be semi-prevalent in the monorepo world, which didn't have a well documented answer (based on my exhaustive Google searching)– and that problem is this: \n\n> How do you use a monorepo that is public, along with my custom app which will be private (without introducing nightmareish workflow issues)? \n\nor in other words: what's the right workflow for monorepos and public and private repositories.. \n\n## First, the problem(s) \n\n### [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) Doesn't Do Much...\n\nAnd what it does do, is sort of a workflow complexifier. The reason I mention it is because lots of people seem to think Lerna is the ultimate monorepo tool while what it does is mostly just run commands in different packages, and help you keep version numbers aligned. \n\nWhat it doesn't do is help you manage your workflow, and if you're not careful you'll end up having to run ```lerna bootstrap``` all the time to make sure your dependencies are kept aligned between packages. \n\n### Yarn Link / NPM Link Will Drive You Crazy\n\nThe **main** point of this article is for me to tell you this: don't try and use NPM or [Yarn Link](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/). Just don't do it. \n\nWhile I'm a fan of Yarn, this feature is really half baked for some reason and the devs don't seem to understand how people want to use it at all.\n\nHere's what I experienced, \n\n1. Use \"Yarn Link\" to add one project into another for workflow purposes. (sounds good!)\n2. *Sets up Yarn Link in Project*\n3. Yarn link adds symlink but coldly refuses to install any dependencies from the linked project. \n4. Googles furiously, only to find years-old articles and bug reports on the subject. \n5. Conclusion: Without dependencies installed from linked projects, I'd either have to manually edit the working projects dependencies to match. Creating a problem in workflow which would likely lead to lots of bugs (\"oh I forgot to add the dependency again\").. or write a build script. \n\nLuckily, a quick solution\n\n## Yarn Workspaces to the Rescue\n\nThe solution for me, obvious in hindsight, is just to use a less typical Yarn Workspace workflow: have two monorepos in the same yarn controlled parent. \n\nI guess you'd just say that having two monorepos inside the same folder. Each with it's own repository (one public and one private). \n\nHere's what it looks like in practice: \n\n![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjsum7bcb%2Fyarn-workspace-workflow.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=e224c30a-ed39-4109-97f4-4136926597a6)\n\n### Config in Package.json\n\nSo as in above, all we need is a \"Yarn Workspace wrapper\" around our two monorepos (which are individually tracked with Git). \n\nYarn Workspaces are really good at tracking and de-duping dependencies and ultimately store everything in ```node_modules``` at the root of the wrapper. \n\nAll you need to do is add the following to the package.json in the wrapper root: \n\n```\nworkspaces: ['@public-monorepo/*', '@private-monorepo/*']\n```\n\nAnd from there it should all work out. \n\n## Summary\n\nThe goal here was to hopefully save somebody some time. This specific structure might not be for everybody, but it's working for us.",

    "content": "**Getting a remote job might be easy, but getting a good, well-paying one is not. The trick is to focus on developing a specialized skillset and a porfolio which demonstrates those skills.**\n\nIn the game of chess, there are several strategies that lead to success. You can attack quickly or slowly. You can try memorized tricks and pick from a number of well-defined openings. \n\nHowever, nearly all the top players use a single positioning-based approach. That's because at the top levels, all the \"tricks\" stop working and getting too aggressive too fast often leads to punishment. \n\nPositioning means setting up the right spots *before you need to use them*. That way, when finally&mdash;at some point&mdash;something breaks lose, you're there to take maximum advantage. \n\nSuccess is sorta like that. It never comes down to one thing or one key event, it's always a series of things. Setting things up to optimize your chances when you finally get that small opportunity, then building from there. \n\nHowever, I see [quite a few remote-job applications](https://www.fiction.com/careers) and I'd say roughly 99% of these folks have fundamental issues with the setup(positioning). In other words, people are always trying to attack before they've property set up their pieces.. In effect, jumping straight to \"hire me!\" instead of becoming the type of professional that I would want to hire. \n\nSo I thought I'd spend a minute to give you some insights&mdash;from someone who has been on both sides of the table&mdash; about [finding remote work](https://www.fiction.com). \n\n![The Three Positions](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjsysbknw%2Fthree-things.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=0a1c1f75-5f95-413d-96f0-2beb435a2747)\n\n## Niche \n\n> The Riches Are In The Niches Bitches! &mdash; A Wise Man\n\nNo one respects the generalist. Being the \"jack of all trades, master of none,\" might have an appeal from a hobbyist perpsective, but employeers want the opposite. They want the \"king of one trade, ignorant of the rest\" type people that ultimately bring companies an advantage. \n\nYou will not get anywhere until you drop your ego, and reflect on the one skillset where you have the potential to be the best in the world. People will respect you more.\n\n## Skip The Resume\n\nIf you're applying to remote jobs with a resume attachment, then you need to stop now.  This practice, which I see roughly 50% of the time, is simply a demonstration that you don't understand the remote work paradigm at all. \n\nThink about it, remote work is about using the latest tools and tech to work from anywhere, yet you're using a PDF resume instead of building a portfolio using any of a million different options to do so? Think about it. \n\nI recommend building a nice AngelList or [Fiction profile](https://www.fiction.com/profile) first, and ideally building a [simple yet beautiful website](https://factor.fiction.com) that demonstrates your key skill set. \n\n(Note: As for a website, it's considered advantageous to build something instead of some quick builder tool. It shows you can build something on your own. However, keep it simple.)\n\n## A Good vs Bad Portfolio\n\nWe also see quite a few porfolios these days, and a good portfolio remains the crux of finding good work. But the problem here is that most portfolios are simply missing the point. \n\nThe point is to demonstrate your ability to create value for your potential employer or customer.\n\nThere is a new phenomenon I call the \"coding-school\" porfolio. These portfolios consist of a few quick demo websites that are designed to show basic understanding of 101 level web tech. Typically, they look like a mish-mash of different features and ideas, are broken in places and use Google's Material Design framework (bleh!).\n\nI understand why coding schools require that people do this. But if your portfolio looks like this, you're only showing that you have the ability to create stuff that is incomplete and broken. \n\nThe solution is to take your time and create something impressive. If you don't have the skills to do that, get them. Then you'll have no problem finding a job. \n\n## Your Online Persona\n\n> \"Wow that's Lisa Berger?! &mdash; Butters\n\nOne of the funniest South Park ever, \"The Hobbit,\" is all about how Photoshop affects people's opinion. In this episode Wendy photoshops a picture of Lisa Berger to demonstrate how much it can improve someone's appearance. And instead of realizing this, Butters just thinks that the Photoshop version represents her real appearance and she's \"hot.\"\n\nPeople actually do think that way. However you look on Instagram *et al* is reality to them. And it may be unfortunate, but you can't change it. \n\nOne of the quickest and easiest things you can do for your online career is to recognize that your online persona&mdash;your appearance on social networks, blogs, email, etc..&mdash; is not only what is important, it's what defines you. \n\nWhat this means is that all your photos need to not only look professional, they also should represent the person you would like to be.  That means remove those festival shots where you were hammered. Or those poorly lit iPhone 4 photos from 2010. \n\n**Less is more.**\n\nAnother thing you should consider is your \"paper trail\" online. If you have political posts, angry tweets, whatever; these can easily derail employment opportunities. No one outside of political organizations would knowingly hire someone with a habit of screaming on social media. \n\nFinally, once you've got a simple online persona; you need to stay consistent. People learn through repeated exposure so changing things up all the time is a lost opportunity.\n\n## Summary \n\nYou can't skip steps. The key to success is first to drop the get rich quick mentality and focus on how you best position your pieces to optimize your chances when you get that first small opportunity. \n\nSome specific advise is to: \n- Reflect on what your niche is (King-of-One-Trade)\n- Drop the resume and focus on building a simple website that demonstrates the value you can provide.\n- Consider minimizing and cleaning up your online persona. Do this by removing unprofessional pictures and cleaning up any unsavory social media posts. \n- Once you have an online persona down, don't change it often (of ever). Impressions are made through repetition.",

          "content": "**Managing private keys in typical Javascript projects is a pain if you follow the recommendations of your backend provider (AWS, Firebase, GCP). However, there is a simpler way to manage things with an encrypted JSON file and a master password.**\n\nIn 2019, web development means working with tons of APIs and microservices. And with these APIs, comes dozens of private keys that need to be managed in your development environment.\n\nAfter some research it seems like no one really presents an 'easy' way of dealing with these so I'd like to propose a new solution: encrypting a JSON and simplifying your 'secrets' to one all important password.\n\n## Typical Approach\n\nThe \"recommended\" approach to private keys is to use what's called \"environmental variables\" which are variables stored with your cloud provider. However, this quickly becomes problematic for two reasons: \n1. Managing private keys in the cloud becomes complicated fast. As even a small project is going to have 10 or more keys to deal with. What keys are stored? What's the name of the variable they are stored under? \n2. Figuring out how to get these keys into appicable environments can be an issue. For me it was a problem using them locally for testing.\n3. Dealing with production vs staging vs development keys makes the problem(s) worse\n\nThe other way some people might deal with this is to have a local file with private keys in it. However, the existence of this file creates security concerns for any grown-up project and adding it to source control is even a worse idea.\n\nSo what's the solution? \n\n## A Better Way to Manage Private Keys\n\nAfter spending some time with Google looking for better ideas, I couldn't find any better recommendations but had an idea. First, let's look at exactly what the solution needs to accomplish:  \n\n1. The \"actual\" keys can never be commited to source control (git)\n2. The keys need to be stored securly somewhere where they can be accessed by all backend services\n3. The key management solution should not create chronic workflow issues\n4. The solution should handle different keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)\n\n### Crypto JSON + A Master Password\n\n![How This Works](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjt1jo6ta%2Fsecrets.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=486ec9b4-993b-4549-91b9-15394d404450)\n\nThe solution is simple.  Simply, use a password to encrypt a JSON file.  That way you can save the encrypted JSON file in source control and only need to deal with a single \"master password\" to unlock it. Here's how it works: \n\n1. Create a local file called private-keys-raw.json. This is a formatted file with all private keys that only top level admins should have access to (no source control)\n2. Create a local passwords.json file (or store the same info in an env variable) \n    -   Note that there should be a password for each build environment. That way you don't need to share the production password with every developer/contractor \n3. Use this NPM package [Crypto JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-json). This allows you to encrypt the file while leaving the formatting in place. \n4. On your server, use the passwords to decrypt the file. Giving you access to your keys. \n\n## Summary\n\nUsing a single passwords field and an encrypted JSON file massively simplifies this common development problem. To recap, all you need to do is: \n- create a passwords file\n- encypt with the passwords\n- decrypt the file in your backend environment \n\nThis meets all the contraints described above, most notably it doesn't create any new workflow problems around security.",

The solution should handle different keys for different environments (dev, staging, production)\n\n### Crypto JSON + A Master Password\n\n![How This Works](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/fiction-com.appspot.com/o/posts%2Fjt1jo6ta%2Fsecrets.jpg.jpg?alt=media&token=486ec9b4-993b-4549-91b9-15394d404450)\n\nThe solution is simple.  Simply, use a password to encrypt a JSON file.  That way you can save the encrypted JSON file in source control and only need to deal with a single \"master password\" to unlock it. Here's how it works: \n\n1. Create a local file called private-keys-raw.json. This is a formatted file with all private keys that only top level admins should have access to (no source control)\n2. Create a local passwords.json file (or store the same info in an env variable) \n    -   Note that there should be a password for each build environment. That way you don't need to share the production password with every developer/contractor \n3. Use this NPM package [Crypto JSON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-json). This allows you to encrypt the file while leaving the formatting in place. \n4. On your server, use the passwords to decrypt the file. Giving you access to your keys. \n\n## Summary\n\nUsing a single passwords field and an encrypted JSON file massively simplifies this common development problem. To recap, all you need to do is: \n- create a passwords file\n- encypt with the passwords\n- decrypt the file in your backend environment \n\nThis meets all the contraints described above, most notably it doesn't create any new workflow problems around security.",
