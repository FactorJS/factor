# Notifications Spec

- Notifications need to be sent on specific events as designated by user
- they should be sent within ~15 minutes of the event occuring,
- notifications should be limited on a daily basis to prevent events going crazy

- event messages should be templated allowing the user to customize it with all available data

- notification system should support extension with other notification platforms, e.g. slack
