# Install on Wix

### Before You Start

To add the Kaption tracking code to your [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) website you need premium account. This is because Kaption is installed via a Tag Manager or as "custom code" which are enabled once you upgrade. Learn more about this on the [Wix help center](https://support.wix.com/en/article/embedding-custom-code-to-your-site).

### Get Tracking Code

Login to [Kaption's Dashboard](https://app.kaption.co/login) and visit "Tracking Code" in the navigation.
