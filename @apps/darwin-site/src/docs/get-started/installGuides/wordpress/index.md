# Install on WordPress

### Before You Start

The Darwin tracking code can be installed on [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) Business plan and self-hosted versions of Wordpress from ([Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/)).

Darwin isn't available for users on a [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) free or personal plan since you cannot add Custom HTML or install plugins on these plans.

### Get Tracking Code

Login to [Darwin's Dashboard](https://app.darwin.so/login) and visit "Tracking Code" in the navigation.

- You may need to clear cache to see changes in your theme.

Once you've saved your changes, you can verify your install on the [Darwin dashboard](https://app.darwin.so).
