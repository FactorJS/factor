# Combining heatmaps with other tools for more insight

Heatmaps show you the perfect visual story of whats happening on your website, they help you fix issues or make quick changes. But when you need extra detail or a more in-depth understanding of how to improve the user experience, you’ll get more out of heatmaps by combining them with other behavior tools.

## Heatmaps and traffic analytics

With traffic web analytics in Darwin, you’ll get plenty of quantitative data points and learn about large-scale traffic and usage patterns—but numbers and charts will not, by themselves, answer questions you might have about what people want from your site, where they get confused, and where their attention goes.

By combining Darwin traffic analytics with heatmaps, you can start a deeper investigation and find out why some of your metrics occur. Got a page with lots of traffic that doesn’t convert? View the heatmap on that page, go through the heatmaps analysis checklist, and start seeing what’s making people stumble.

## Heatmaps and variant testing

Heatmaps and variant testing are a two-way street: you can use heatmap data to define a hypothesis for a future split test, and you can also run heatmaps on variant test variations to provide more insight into why page versions are or aren’t successful.

## Heatmaps and session replays

While heatmaps help you visualize data from page visitors in aggregate, session replays are created for individual users and show you their actions across multiple pages.

Session replays are renderings of user browsing sessions, and they help you bring more clarity to some of the insights you pick up from a heatmap. Instead of making assumptions about the user interaction you see on a heatmap, try viewing some session replays and see how your users actually interact with your site.
