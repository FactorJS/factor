# Philosophy and Style

## Rules To Live By

Factor follows [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) regarding the way it's developed. This can be summarized by the following:

- **Portability over efficiency.** Modular code that can be removed or included stand-alone (e.g. in a test) is more important than concepts like DRY.
- **Small and opinionated.** Parts of the Factor program should strive to be as small in size and scope as possible. Options should be removed in favor of elegant defaults.
- **Design for fewer special cases.** Strive to code in a way that doesn't require special cases (i.e. if/else's).
