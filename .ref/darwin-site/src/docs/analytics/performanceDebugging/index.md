description: Use Darwin to track your site's performance and monitor for issues with errors and broken UI
---

Darwin tracks special information regarding loading performance and errors that occur when users use your site.

Use the performance and debugging tools to monitor and rapidly respond to issues.

## How It Works

Darwin measures several technical flags that occur as people browse your website or app. For example, we track the following:

- **Page Vitals:** Important page loading details as described by Google.
- **Errors:** Any JavaScript errors that occur as people interact with your site
- **Network Performance:** The way your website performs over the network for your users in aggregate. This can help identify if certain scripts are loading slow, etc.

## Review Errors and Site Performance

You can access the analytic and aggregations for your site errors and performance on the [performance dashboard](https://app.darwin.so/site/_id_/dash/performance) in the app.
