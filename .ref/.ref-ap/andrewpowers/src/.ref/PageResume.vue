              I am currently working on various startup ideas. Recently I've
              worked on products using AI and machine learning, data analytics,
              booking and reservations, and content syndication.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most my career, I've focused on software architecture, product
              planning and design, data visualization, and engineering
              management. My professional experience goes back to 2008 when I
              started a company called PageLines, which I built from a
              consultancy to over 70,000 customers
