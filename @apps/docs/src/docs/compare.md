# Comparing Factor

## Overview

Today there are hundreds of technologies and frameworks to consider when building a web app. We realize that Factor may not be ideally suited for every use case. And in fact, we would prefer not to bloat the platform through attempting to cater to everyone.

Here we'll discuss some of the various development approaches and their advantages and disadvantages.

### The "Target" User

As discussed in the [Factor Introduction](./), Factor is designed for **front-end developers** (like us).

The Factor concept itself was created because of the wish list of features and ideas we wanted to see in a JS platform.

#### Goals

- **Designer friendly code only** (Abstract away painful-to-work-with tools.)
- **Useful theming that works**
- **Easy to install plugins**
- **No proprietary APIs or lock in**
- **Full-Stack Javascript**
- **No reinventing the wheel**

#### Non-Goals

- **No "magic"** - Things should not just happen without having to explicitly define the functionality. For example, routes should not auto generate. Magic creates bloat (as you modify and customize) and mysterious bugs.
- **No builders or drag-and-drop** - The concept of "no coding" is usually not what front-end developers want. They'd rather build things to a "standard" as opposed to learning proprietary (and often janky) drag and drop tools. (Note that extensions could easily provide this functionality.)
