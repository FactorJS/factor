## What is User Experience?

Do you ever wonder how using certain products make you feel? Do you get frustrated or are you delighted? The feelings and emotions that interacting with products evoke in us can be referred to as user experience.

User experience is your users' holistic perception of their experience with your business or brand.

## Why is UX important for your business?

Delivering a great user experience is hugely important for any business. The better experience users have, the more repeat custom and positive reviews you'll receive.

The benefits of delivering a great UX include:

- increased user loyalty
- increased user satisfaction
- better word-of-mouth marketing, positive reviews, and recommendations

## The Elements of the User Experience Process

### User Research

User research is the starting point of any user-centered design. It’s also a continuous process that helps designers enhance the usability of an up-and-running product.

Visual design is a term used to describe the look and feel of a product. It includes elements such as the app’s or site’s layout, colors, or the symbols that help users interact with the interface. Visual design concepts are tested out by UX designers through wireframes and prototypes.

### Usability

The term ‘usability’ describes the degree to which a product can be used by its target audience so that they can reach their goals. There are five constituents to usability – a product’s learnability, efficiency, memorability, its errors, and the levels of user satisfaction.

### Accessibility

Lastly, accessibility is the rate at which a product can be easily used, understood, and reached by a disabled individual. This might mean, for instance, designing a voice interface for the visually impaired, or enabling a bigger font or element size for the elderly.

## The benefits of a great user experience process

So, what benefits does following the user experience design process provide? Below are some of the most prominent ones:

- **Higher conversion rate**: if you ensure that your site visitors can easily find the information they are looking for, you raise your chances of improving conversion.
- **User retention improvement**: when a product offers a rewarding experience, users will be more likely to return to it.
- **A stronger brand**: great user experiences are also memorable ones. This means that, by ensuring flawless UX, you can strengthen your brand image and boost the chances of getting a positive review online.
