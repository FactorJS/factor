### Customizing Theme Settings

This theme uses Factor's native theme settings system.

Copy the [theme settings.js file](https://github.com/fiction-com/factor/blob/master/%40factor/%40themes/theme-alpha/src/settings.js) and place in your applications source folder `src`.

Edit the settings you'd like to change, the result will be merged with the theme settings file.
