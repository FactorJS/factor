# How to create a user journey map that improves customer success

Launching a product or service is an exciting process. Every product owner wants to turn first-time buyers into repeat customers. However, this requires a deeper understanding of who they are and what they need.

By going through the process of creating a user journey map, you can design in a way that gets your users motivated, and provide them with the results they desire to achieve with your product.

Before we start creating a user journey map, it is important to understand what a user journey entails. So, lets review what user journey is and what it means.

## What is a user journey?

A user journey is the cumulative experience of a user while interacting with your product. It is a well-detailed explanation of each step your users take to complete specific tasks within an application, system, or a website. This lets you discover the current user workflow, as well as uncovers improvement areas. A user journey also provides a precise timeline of user actions and a visualization of their product interactions. When the user journey is documented by design and product specialists who are working on enhancing a product or service, it is usually known as a user journey map.

## The benefits of developing a user journey map

Are you looking to give your company a boost and increase product sales? If done efficiently and regularly, user journey mapping can be one of the most effective strategies for uplifting a business. Here are some of the major benefits of generating a user journey map:

### Bringing the entire team on the same wavelength

Mapping user experiences encourages collaboration and teamwork which aligns the goals and visualizations of everyone on board. Journey maps are a great option for delivering precise information that helps create a shared vision. These maps also form the basis of decision making as the entire team transitions into the process.

### Showcasing the user journey as a complete package

A user journey is a long-drawn process that is completed by taking a series of specific steps. User mapping showcases these steps as an entire journey. This helps the team in discussing the goals of the journey including business and end-user goals and their alignment with the goals of the organization.

### Allowing for user scenario analysis

User experience mapping makes it easy to evaluate and understand various user scenarios. It enables the team to test out several user journeys and select the best performing one via an informed process. Journey maps are best fitted for scenarios that involve a series of events such as shopping or taking a trip or describing a process that will involve a set of transitions over time.

### Identifying the user journey loopholes

Journey mapping lets you recoil and observe the entire user journey process with a different lens. The weak links and loopholes that you were unable to see before now become apparent. This also helps you understand the problems experienced by your end-users when interacting with your product. On user maps, these points are generally represented as ‘dips’ in the journey diagram (see the example below), so you can spot potentially underperforming areas and compare them with other low points in the journey. This also gives you the ability to create a list of the much-needed optimizations.

### Spotting unnecessary processes and touchpoints

Another great advantage of a user experience map is the ability to identify steps that can be disposed of to make the user experience more seamless and cohesive. Eliminating an existing step that is no longer required or adding an efficient step to the process can all be achieved with ease if you have a journey map.

Now that you understand the benefits of building a user journey map, learn how to create one.
