If you have kids you know how this works.

They can have a toy that they haven't played with in months. You couldn't pay them to play with it.

But when their sibling comes along and starts playing with it, suddenly it's the most important item in the world.

This is the Rivalry bias.

A combination of scarcity and competition causes people to mindlessly want the object of that competition.

## Competition and Motivation

The feeling of being in competition with someone else is a powerful motivator.

For example, when dating, the ardor of a potential partner is often increased when they see you with someone else. A rival.

That's why many romantic partners will subtly reveal the competition to their preferred partner.

In sales, they play the same game. They'll often tell you that someone else is interested in the product you're looking at.

Sales coaches call this "goosing them off the fence."

Only a few months ago I was buying a new car, and dragging my feet. The sales person mentioned that someone else was coming to look at the car.

I knew this was probably a tactic, but it still worked. I thought, "well, there is a chance he's telling the truth..." So I bought the car.

## Unequal Results

Another thing that will drive people crazy is when they see someone else getting better results than them.

As Buffett says, "envy, not greed, drives the world."

So often if people are afraid of missing out, they will move all obstacles to get in the game.

In this famous Ted talk, Frans de Waal demonstrates this with monkeys:

## How To Use It

A version of this tactic has been standardized by sites like Airbnb and Booking.com. They mention how many rooms are left, or how many people are looking at the property.

There are other ways to leverage it however.

If you're selling a software product, it may seem strange, but you can always introduce artificial limits to new customers or accounts.

This was famously done by Mailbox, a company Dropbox [ended up buying](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/dropbox-buys-mailbox-all-13-employees-joining-and-app-will-remain-separate/) for a large amount.

They created an artificial waiting list, saying you were "number 10,000 in line" to get access to the app.

This created a huge amount of buzz, a result of the frenzy of competition to be "allowed" to use the app.

These days, you'll need to be a bit more subtle and clever.

But the principle is the same.
