Many of you are familiar with the artist, Banksy. He's known for his unique graffiti artwork and his identity remains a mystery. This makes him one of the most discussed artists today.

In 2015, Banksy presented an art exhibition named "Dismaland". It was hosted at a disused place called the Tropicana and was described as a "family theme park unsuitable for children." The event generated a lot of buzz, and my girlfriend and I were eager to see it. So, we traveled 3.5 hours by car to experience it.

To be honest, we didn't have the best time.

It wasn't the event itself; we made a regrettable decision which clouded our experience.

Let me dive deeper into our experience at Dismaland.

Upon entering, we noticed a long queue for the "Water Canon Creek" exhibit. Even though other exhibits had shorter lines, we assumed this one must be the best. We waited nearly 90 minutes, only to find the exhibit underwhelming. It had obscure art pieces inside a van, and the reason for the delay? People were reading the descriptions beside each piece.

So, why did we wait? We saw a big line and assumed it was worth it.

This behavior is known as “Social Proof” – where we believe something is good because many others are endorsing it.

Now, how does this apply to business?

It's not always about having a physical queue outside your establishment. It's about making clients believe that many others trust your services.

A clear understanding of this concept can help you in various business situations:

### Scenario 1: Rescheduling Appointments

If someone asks to reschedule, rather than immediately agreeing, indicate that you're quite booked but can offer an alternative time. This portrays you as in-demand.

### Scenario 2: Office Visits

When someone visits your office, try to have them see another client leaving or coming in. This can be perceived as you being sought after.

## Is this manipulative?

Some might see these strategies as deceptive. However, if you genuinely believe in the quality of your service and know you're better than most in your industry, these tactics can guide clients to make a right choice. But, if you're not genuinely offering value, no strategy will save your reputation.
