# Adding Routes and Stores

## Routes and Views

Once you're familiar with the concept behind Factor's filters system, let's discuss how to add views to your app.

For routing, Factor implements the [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) module used by 99% of Vue apps. Therefore, the API is very similar with only one key difference: that routes are inserted via Factor filters. Also, there are different parent contexts available for routes, that are important depending on how the framework is being used.

### View Components

View components are just regular Vue components, only they are designed to wrap all components in a specific route. View components are loaded in component templates using the `router-view` functional component.

### Content Routes

Most front-end views in Factor are added via the simple `content-routes` filter. This is a parent route, which uses the required `content.vue` component as a wrapper for all front-end routes. To add a front end view, like a home page or a tour, you'll just do the following:

```javascript
addFilter("content-routes", routes => {
  // Important:
  // Return the modified value
  // Here we add new routes to any other added content routes
  return [
    ...routes,
    {
      path: "/",
      component: () => import("./page-home.vue"),
      meta: { background: "#fafbff" } // Add meta information available to all components (e.g. this.$route.meta.background from component)
    },
    {
      path: `/tour`,
      component: () => import("./page-tour.vue")
    }
  ]
})
```

## Stores for Data

In web frameworks, a "store" is a globally available object that holds application data and keeps it no matter where you go in your app. While the the store pattern is popular, it is often overused and can be problematic due to its global nature. However, the store is quite necessary in the case of SSR.
