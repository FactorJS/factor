# The benefits of using heatmaps on your website

Heatmaps help you understand how people interact with your website pages, so you can find answers to business-critical questions such as ‘why are my users not converting?’ or ‘how do I get more visitors to take action?’ Using heatmaps, you can determine if people are:

- Reaching important content or failing to see it
- Finding and using a page’s main links, buttons, opt-ins, and CTAs
- Getting distracted by non-clickable elements
- Experiencing issues across devices

As a visual tool, heatmaps help you make informed, data-based decisions for A/B testing, updating, or (re)designing your website. And they are also useful on a wider business scale: heatmaps let you show team members and stakeholders what’s happening and get their buy-in more easily when changes are needed—it’s hard to argue with a heatmap!
