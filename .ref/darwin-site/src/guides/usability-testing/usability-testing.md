# All you need to know about usability testing

Usability testing is all about getting real people to interact with your website/product and observing their behavior and reactions to it. Building products is complex and requires lots of decision making. Usability testing is a necessary step to make sure you involve your users or customers in the decision-making process and ensure that your product perfectly meets their needs.

## What is Usability Testing?

It’s an examination of how users interact with a product to identify its strengths, weaknesses, and issues which need fixing urgently. Usability testing revolves around quality improvement which is based on five components:

- **Learnability** – how easy or difficult is it for users to complete a task for the first time they use your solution?
- **Efficiency** – how efficient is it to perform a task?
- **Memorability** – how simple is it to return to using your product after not using it for weeks or months?
- **Errors or bugs** – is error recovery quick and easy?
- **Satisfaction** – is your design enjoyable to use?

## Why is usability testing important?

Usability testing is done by real users, who are likely to reveal issues that people familiar with a website can no longer identify. Bringing in new users to test your site or observing how real people are already using it are effective ways to determine whether your visitors:

- Understand how your site works and don't get 'lost' or confused
- Can complete the main actions they need to
- Don't encounter usability issues or bugs
- Have a functional and efficient experience
- Notice any usability problems

This is important with new products or updates: without it, you may be stuck with process that your target audience doesn't understand.

## Main Benefits of usability testing

Conducting usability testing will bring you significant benefits, such as:

- **Enhanced user experience** – when it comes to product selection, customers have plenty of options. Good user experience is necessary to prevent losing your users
- **Improved conversion** – shortening the path to conversion will have a positive impact on boosting your conversion rate
- **Data points discovery** - a heatmap might show that people aren't paying attention to an important part of the landing page, but observing users in action can reveal why they're ignoring it.
- **Revenue increase** – usability issues can result in revenue losses
- **Showing commitment to great UX** – working towards providing a seamless UX will show your customers that you care about them

## Summary

Usability testing is essential if you want to improve your user experience and surpass your competitors. Making it a continuous process will allow you to improve your customer satisfaction levels, adjust your product to the market that's always changing, and optimize product development costs.
