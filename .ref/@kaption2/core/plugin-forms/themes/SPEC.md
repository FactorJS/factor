- iFrame benefits

  - iFrame respects media queries
  - iFrame is responsive
  - encourages isolation and 'true' preview of content

- iFrame downsides

  - slower to update
  - more technical
  - not as rich

- inline benefits

  - easier to work with dynamically
  - not responsive in same way as real deployment

- inline downsides
  - harder to preview
