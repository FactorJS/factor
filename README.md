## Getting started

```
$ yarn factor <project-name>
```

It's as simple as that!

## Themes
Start by using the basic Factor app [starter theme](#starter-theme-url)

## Examples

Please take a look at https://factor.dev/examples

## Production deployment

To deploy, instead of running factor, you probably want to build ahead of time. Therefore, building and starting are separate commands:

```bash
code code code
```

For example, to deploy with [`now`](https://zeit.co/now) a `package.json` like follows is recommended:
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "dependencies": {
    "factor": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "factor",
    "build": "factor build",
    "start": "factor start"
  }
}
```

Then run `now` and enjoy!

Note: we recommend putting `.factor` in `.npmignore` or `.gitignore`.
